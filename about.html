      &emsp;&emsp;â€“Gag Halfrunt, on Wyatt Ward
    </div>
    <div class="postarea"><ul><li>I'm currently attending Purdue Fort Wayne.</li>
        <li>I use almost exclusively Unix-like operating systems.
          &emsp;I currently have Debian Sid on my desktop and laptop, and FreeBSD and Android-x86 on my laptop as well.</li>
        <li>I love old technologies, and wish I owned and had space for a Teletype.</li>
        <li>I drive a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volvo_200_Series">Volvo 240 station wagon</a>. I wish I had the tools to fix anything that goes wrong with it, but I do what I can.</li>
        <li>I am trying to reduce my electronics collection, but I also really don't want to.</li>
        <li>I first learned to program on a Commodore VIC-20.</li>
        <li>I love talking with people about basically everything.</li>
        <li>I sometimes wonder if I talk too much and listen too little, but I seem to be able to keep friends who reach out to me anyway.</li>
        <li>I like to read. Especially fantasy and/or humor. Terry Pratchett's Discworld books are great.</li>
        <li>I like classic cinema, but I have a hard time trying to find new movies that I want to watch (with a couple exceptions; I love Wes Anderson)
          &emsp;I always am afraid that that might mean I enjoy movies because I'm trying to project an image of myself, but then I remember that Hollywood hasn't made original movies in decades.</li>
        <li><i>The Blues Brothers</i> is amazing.</li>
        <li>I enjoy Common Lisp and old HP RPL calculators.
          &emsp;My favorite calculator is the HP-28S.
          &emsp;Yes, I have used an HP-48SX. I prefer the 28S because of the keyboard and its smaller size.</li>
        <li>I have and use an IBM 3161 RS-232c ASCII terminal, <a href="https://github.com/wyatt8740/IBM3161-font">which I also re-created the font of</a>.</li>
        <li>I have an Amiga 500. I am always looking for something interesting to do with it beyond playing games and using DeluxePaint.</li>
        <li>If my school's firewall would let me, I'd be hosting this site on my desktop instead of through Github.</li>
        <li>I try not to be a tech extremist, but I sometimes fail miserably.<ul>
            <li><i>Systemd <a href="https://github.com/systemd/systemd/issues/5755">should not have a DNS service</a></i> <a href="https://askubuntu.com/questions/907246/how-to-disable-systemd-resolved-in-ubuntu/907249">[2]</a>.</li>
            <li><i>Systemd <a href="https://www.theregister.co.uk/2018/10/26/systemd_dhcpv6_rce/">should not have a DHCP client</a></i>.</li>
            <li><i>Sound worked fine until I installed PulseAudio</i>.</li>
            <li><i>Mozilla Firefox gets worse with each release, but still apparently thinks it's working for the benefit of its users by removing the ALSA backend and by making it less customizable for developers</i>.</li>
