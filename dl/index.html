      Descriptions of some of the files here:
    </p>
    <p>
      <a href="android">/android/</a>: contains some AOSP android 10 software
      which I compiled for my pixel 4, as well as a handful of other programs
      I built or modified for my own purposes. For example, "set orientation"
      is useful for setting the rotation of a phone manually or overriding
      programs that lock rotation. It used to be on the play store but has
      been gone for a long time from there.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a href="ddc">/ddc/</a>: Display Data Channel (DDC) communication wrapper
      shell script that attempts to make it easier to interface with desktop
      computer monitor settings (like brightness, contrast, white balance) than
      the "ddcutil" program does on its own. Uses "ddcutil" under the hood to
      accomplish this, but allows for commands like <code>cintiq set brightness
        5</code> or <code>cintiq setrgb cintiq setrgb 203 213 255</code>, where
      "cintiq" is the name of the script which has been edited to specifically
      target a specific DDC bus number that a wacom display is residing on.
      <br/>
      Check DDC bus numbers with <code>ddcutil detect</code>.
      <br/>
      Nvidia proprietary driver users may need to add
      <code>options nvidia NVreg_RegistryDwords=RMUseSwI2c=0x01;RMI2cSpeed=100</code>
      to their modprobe settings for this to work.
      <br/>
      Also note that Cintiqs appear to swap the meaning of "brightness" and
      "contrast" when compared to other LCD's that can be controlled via DDC,
      so the cintiq script has been edited accordingly
      (swapping VCP ID's 10 and 12).
    </p>
    <p>
      <a href="drivers">/drivers/</a>: Archive of drivers for computer
      hardware. This stuff might be backed up elsewhere, but I haven't checked
      and these are from my own personal copies. Currently the only driver
      diskette is for a first generation IBM ScrollPoint mouse. This is from an
      untouched floppy disk that I got still in the shrinkwrap with a new old
      stock ScrollPoint mouse (a mouse with a trackpoint on it for two
      dimensional scrolling).
    </p>
    <p>
      <a href="fc_palette">/fc_palette/</a>: My custom Famicom/NES colour
      palettes, based on video captures. As of this writing they do not contain
      the "emphasis bit" combinatorial colours, so those have to be calculated
      by the emulator, but I am highly satisfied with how the basic colours
      look and it is a very close match to what I see on my screens. Check them
      out! :)
    </p>
    <p>
      <a href="floppy_disk_stuff">/floppy_disk_stuff/</a>: Right now this is
      just a 3D model made in OpenSCAD for a center hub for 3.5 inch (90 mm)
      floppy disks. Both the original OpenSCAD sources and a rendered STL file
      are included. For an ongoing project of mine. The measurements were taken
      from an ECMA standard I forget the number of that defines the 90mm floppy
      disk format and physical specifications.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a href="gdrive.txt">/gdrive.txt</a>: A script for downloading files from
      google drive links on the command line without opening them in a browser;
      it also bypasses the antivirus scan warning page (which states that a
      file was too big for scanning) for applicable files. It does not
      currently work on drive folders, only on links to specific files.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a href="jxl-ppc">/jxl-ppc/</a>: Jpeg XL reference implementation source
      code patches for building the library on 32-bit PowerPC systems. Includes
      patches for both <code>libjxl</code> and <code>libhwy</code>
      (libhighway). The highway patch disables SIMD entirely and makes the
      library operate in scalar fashion because AltiVec is not supported (at
      least, not when I last checked). The jxl patch also disables emscripten,
      since NodeJS has not worked on 32-bit PowerPC in many years and the build
      system refuses to continue without it otherwise (and because NodeJS sucks
      anyway).
    </p>
    <p>
      <a href="moz">/moz/</a>: Patches for the fork of Firefox I maintain for
      my own personal use in order to make it work the way I want it to, be
      able to be styled with <code>userChrome.css</code> to my liking somewhat
      more easily, and to roll back some changes I hate (like the removal of
      the ability to view an image on a page in the current tab). Planning to
      update this whenever I make a new build of Firefox. It's a real hassle to
      do, so if you're depending on me, be prepared to wait several months at
      least.
      <br/>
      There's also a script for extracting cookies from mozilla's cookies
      SQLite file in a format that can be pasted into the website scraper
      program <code>gallery-dl</code>.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a href="np2kai">/np2kai/</a>: Patches for Neko Project II Kai, an NEC
      PC-9801 series computer emulator. Currently the patches are mainly
      targetting and tested for linux systems using <code>xnp21kai</code> with
      the GTK2 frontend. The only patch right now simply adds a 3x
      magnification mode so that it can fill the screen on a 1920x1200 monitor.
      A windows patch is included but it is untested and it will likely remain
      so.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a href="pc98">/pc98/</a>: Source code and 3D models related to the NEC
      PC-98 and Epson 98 clone machines. Currently there is a C program called
      <code>DUMPVRAM</code>, whichâ€¦dumps your VRAM to a file. There is also a
      3D model of a gear for the eject mechanism of an NEC CDR-260 CD-ROM drive
      which often breaks. I have not tested this, but I think it might work.
      OpenSCAD sources are included for the gear as well as the gear library
      that I used.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a href="phantasy_star_apng.png">/phantasy_star_apng.png</a>: an animated
      PNG in APNG format of crawling through a three dimensional maze in the
      1987 game "Phantasy Star" for the Sega Master System (SMS). I've removed
      all the battle interruptions so it's just a nice satisfying crawl.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a href="roland">/roland/</a>: This one's only available if I'm
      self-hosting the site, which I have not finished doing yet. It's got
      owners' manuals for some Roland synthesizers, mostly grabbed from
      Roland's websites for various countries (US and Japan primarily). For
      things released in the US that aren't on Roland's US website (like the
      MT-32), scanned PDF's are provided. My SC-55K never got a US release
      so that's only available in Japanese, but the SC-55ST manual in English
      is also included so that it can be compared, since they are similar to
      each other as well as the 55 Mk. II.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a href="saves">/saves/</a>: A GameCube memory card dump of mine from
      2012 or so. Contains saves for Paper Mario: The Thousand Year Door and
      Super Smash Bros. Melee, and I think also a couple others. There's also
      some pre-made "GameShark" saves that were included on a pink Mad Catz
      memory card when I bought it in an EB Games/GameStop(?) back in the day.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a href="xquake">/xquake/</a>: Screenshots from my patched version of
      XQuake which doubles the maximum possible screen resolution for a
      software-rendered game (which is of course the only true way to play
      Quake).
