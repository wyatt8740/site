This is currently my NES/Famicom palette of choice for use in emulators.
If I had NESRGB or HDMINES, I'd also be using it there.

I made it myself, since I have long been annoyed by all other palettes for
various reasons.

-------------

v0 is my initial capture, using my NXP SAA7113H (video processor) and em2861
(USB interface chip) video capture USB stick. This was in the form of a
"Roxio Easy VHS to USB" stick, but such USB's are also widely found in the
ezcap DC60+ and /some/ the various easycap clones.

I did no adjustments to the default settings on it; just captured them as-is.
I used ffmpeg's tblend filter to merge pairs of frames together to try to
eliminate some noise, after also converting the 480i fields back into 240p
frames using ffmpeg's separatefields filter.

I generated bars of color on the Famicom using a demo ROM and averaged a large
area of each color to determine my RGB triplets.

It looks nice, I think, but kind of desaturated. Almost like a GBA. Still not
bad, though, and way better than the FCEUX default palette for instance. I also
prefer it to Nestopia's "Canonical" one and BMF Final V2 (BMF Final V2 was my
go-to palette until now).

v1 is done with the same USB, but with some of the user-adjustable settings
tweaked to make it subjectively closer to my Panasonic BT-H1390YN CRT broadcast
monitor. This made it look a little bit more colorful and generally a bit
darker (but not too badly, I think). I am really happy with v1 so far.

The settings on the em2861/SAA7113H Roxio capture USB for this capture were as
follows:

    brightness:      min=0 max=255 step=1 default=128 value=115
    contrast:        min=0 max=127 step=1 default=64 value=80
    saturation:      min=0 max=127 step=1 default=64 value=90
    hue:     min=-128 max=127 step=1 default=0 value=0
    volume:  min=0 max=31 step=1 default=31 value=31
    mute:    default=1 value=0
    red_balance:     min=-48 max=48 step=1 default=0 value=0
    blue_balance:    min=-48 max=48 step=1 default=0 value=0
    sharpness:       min=0 max=15 step=1 default=0 value=0
    chroma_agc:      default=1 value=0
    chroma_gain:     min=0 max=127 step=1 default=40 value=40
