        Don't expect much, but maybe I'll post stuff occasionally when I've done something that I think is neat. Or when I find something that I think is most definitely not neat and want to rant about POSIX compliance.

      <p>
        Hello, I'm Wyatt Ward. Welcome to my small site.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="postarea">
      <h2>What this Site is For</h2>
      <p>
        I've not been too active in sharing my discoveries/things I've learned
        with the wider world, so this site (and particularly the
        <a href="./blog/">blog</a>) are part of an attempt to fix that by
        giving me somewhere to do my write-ups on whatever strikes my fancy.
      </p>
      <p>
        I do this in the hope that it helps someone, gives a small insight into
        what I'm learning, or maybe even explains a little about how my brain
        works.
      </p>
      <p>
        While I expect it to largely remain technical, I am not going to
        restrict myself to that. If I feel like writing about something, I'm
        going to do so. That often means technology, but not necessarily
        always.
      </p>
      <p>
        I also think I might be helpful to others if I start writing about
        stuff I had to find out for myselfâ€“ stuff that that wasn't documented
        already in a guide somewhere, or else was documented by an out-of-date
        guide that was only somewhat applicable to a specific task at hand.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="postarea">    
      <h2>On this Site's Design</h2>
      <p>
        This site is written so that it will display adequately on many devices
        and browsers while requiring minimal processing power or RAM. Sure, I
        could have used Bootstrap or any number of other CSS or Javascript
        frameworks, but performance would suffer and the page would also
        stand out less. I have tried to keep the site's CSS and HTML as
        pragmatic as possible, while also attempting to achieve acceptable
        results on a wide variety of rendering engines.
      </p>
      <p>
        It has been tested in browsers going back to Lynx, Internet Explorer 6,
        and Dillo. This is good news for all of the two people who still use
        IE6 for anything, although there you may have trouble with HTTPS
        certificate validation. Were I hosting the site myself, it would be
        available via both HTTP and HTTPS, thus avoiding the issue. I suspect
        it will work properly in IE 5 as well, but I have not had a chance to
        test that out yet.
      </p>
      <p>
        So, regardless of how you feel about "Web 1.0," please keep in mind
        my goals when designing this site. Remember that my priority was to
        make this site fast, lightweight, readable, and compatible. If you
        have suggestions on how I can improve readability or usability, do not
        hesitate to let me know.
      </p>
      <h2>On Javascript</h2>
      <p>
        I love Javascript, and think it's fun sometimes, but I'd much rather
        have a page that's easily accessible to everyone, regardless of their
        computing power and living situation. Since there is no reason my site
        <b>should</b> need Javascript, I see no reason to introduce it as a
        requirement.
      </p>
      <p>
        I have added a light and dark mode, implemented entirely using symbolic
        links. No need for Javascript, cookies, or server side page processing!
        The only difference is which CSS file is symlinked to. The light CSS
        hides the light mode button, and the dark CSS hides the dark mode
        button.
      </p>
