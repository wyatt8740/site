    <!--<div class="postarea">Hello, and welcome to an experimental site thing.<br/>
       Don't expect much, but maybe I'll post stuff occasionally when I've done something that I think is neat. Or when I find something that I think is most definitely not neat and want to rant about POSIX compliance.

        Hello, welcome to my small site.
      </p>
      <p>
        I've not been too active in sharing my discoveries/things I've learned with the wider world, so this (especially the <a href="./blerg/">blog</a>) is an attempt to fix that by giving me somewhere to do my write-ups. I hope this helps someone, and also gives a small insight into what I'm learning and maybe even how my brain works.
      </p>
      <p>
        I expect that this blog will remain largely technical, but that's merely because I don't feel like writing about visual art, literature, history, and that sort of thing nearly as much as I do learning about them. I also think I might be more helpful to others by writing about stuff I had to find out for myself that wasn't documented already in a guide somewhere, or else was documented by an out-of-date guide that is only somewhat applicable to a specific task at hand. For instance, as I write this, I'm setting up a Debian cross-compilation environment targetting 32-bit PowerPC CPU's running Linux. Without writing down what I do somewhere, it will take just as long next time I decide to do it as it is taking this time.
      <p>
        Sorry about the aesthetics of the site; I whipped this up very quickly in CSS. The CSS itself is relatively pragmatic, but quite basic. Some other time I'll work on it more, and maybe add more colors/media. But for now, Web 1.0 it is!
