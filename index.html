    <!--<div class="postarea">Hello, and welcome to an experimental site thing.<br/>
       Don't expect much, but maybe I'll post stuff occasionally when I've done something that I think is neat. Or when I find something that I think is most definitely not neat and want to rant about POSIX compliance.

        Hello, I'm Wyatt Ward. Welcome to my small site.
      </p>
      <p>
        I've not been too active in sharing my discoveries/things I've learned
        with the wider world, so this (especially the
        <a href="./blog/">blog</a>) is an attempt to fix that by giving me
        somewhere to do my write-ups. I hope this helps someone, and perhaps
        also gives a small insight into what I'm learning, or maybe even an
        insight into how my brain works.
      </p>
      <p>
        While I expect it to largely remain technical, I am not going to
        restrict myself to that. If I feel like writing about something, I'm
        going to do so. That often means technology, but not necessarily
        always.
      </p>
      <p>
        I also think I might be helpful to others if I start writing about
        stuff I had to find out for myselfâ€“ stuff that that wasn't documented
        already in a guide somewhere, or else was documented by an out-of-date
        guide that was only somewhat applicable to a specific task at hand.
      </p>
      <p>
        Regardless of how you feel about "Web 1.0," note that I have done my
        best to make this site fast, lightweight, readable, and compatible with
        a wide range of browsers. It is currently tested working in everything
        from Chrome and Firefox to the smaller browsers like Netsurf, Dillo,
        and Lynx.
      </p>
      <p>
        I love Javascript, and think it's fun sometimes, but I'd much rather
        have a page that's easily accessible to everyone, regardless of their
        computing power and living situation.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you want to contact me, my e-mail address can be found on my GitLab
        or GitHub account page. If you have questions, comments, or even want
        to hire me, don't hesitate to get in touch!
