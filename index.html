       Don't expect much, but maybe I'll post stuff occasionally when I've done something that I think is neat. Or when I find something that I think is most definitely not neat and want to rant about POSIX compliance.

        Hello, I'm Wyatt. Welcome to my small site.
      </p>
      <p>
        I've not been too active in sharing my discoveries/things I've learned
        with the wider world, so this (especially the
        <a href="./blog/">blog</a>) is an attempt to fix that by giving me
        somewhere to do my write-ups. I hope this helps someone, and perhaps
        also gives a small insight into what I'm learning, or maybe even an
        insight into how my brain works.
      </p>
      <p>
        I expect that this blog will remain largely technical, but that's
        merely because I don't feel like writing about visual art, literature,
        history, and that sort of thing nearly as much as I do reading about
        them. I also think I might be more helpful to others by writing about
        stuff I had to find out for myself that wasn't documented already in a
        guide somewhere, or else was documented by an out-of-date guide that is
        only somewhat applicable to a specific task at hand. For instance, as I
        write this, I'm setting up a Debian cross-compilation environment
        targetting 32-bit PowerPC CPU's running Linux. Without writing down
        what I do somewhere, it will take just as long next time I decide to do
        it as it is taking this time.
      <p>
        Sorry about the aesthetics of the site; I whipped this up very quickly
        in CSS on a whim. The CSS itself is relatively pragmatic, but quite
        basic. Some other time I'll work on it more, and maybe add more
        colors/media. But for now, Web 1.0 it is!
      </p>
      <p>
        Regardless of how you feel about "Web 1.0," note that I have done my
        best to make this site fast, lightweight, readable, and compatible with
        a wide range of browsers. It is currently tested working in everything
        from Chrome and Firefox to the smaller browsers like Netsurf, Dillo,
        and Lynx.
      </p>
      <p>
        I love Javascript, and think it's really neat sometimes, but I'd much
        rather have a page that's easily accessible to everyone, regardless of
        their computing power and living situation.
