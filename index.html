    <!--<div class="postarea">Hello, and welcome to an experimental site thing.<br/>
       Don't expect much, but maybe I'll post stuff occasionally when I've done something that I think is neat. Or when I find something that I think is most definitely not neat and want to rant about POSIX compliance.

      <p>
        Hello, I'm Wyatt Ward. Welcome to my small site.
      </p>
      <p>
        I've not been too active in sharing my discoveries/things I've learned
        with the wider world, so this (especially the
        <a href="./blog/">blog</a>) is an attempt to fix that by giving me
        somewhere to do my write-ups. I hope this helps someone, and perhaps
        also gives a small insight into what I'm learning, or maybe even an
        insight into how my brain works.
      </p>
      <p>
        While I expect it to largely remain technical, I am not going to
        restrict myself to that. If I feel like writing about something, I'm
        going to do so. That often means technology, but not necessarily
        always.
      </p>
      <p>
        I also think I might be helpful to others if I start writing about
        stuff I had to find out for myselfâ€“ stuff that that wasn't documented
        already in a guide somewhere, or else was documented by an out-of-date
        guide that was only somewhat applicable to a specific task at hand.
      </p>
      <p>
        Regardless of how you feel about "Web 1.0," note that I have done my
        best to make this site fast, lightweight, readable, and compatible with
        a wide range of browsers. It is currently tested working in everything
        from Chrome and Firefox to the smaller browsers like Netsurf, Dillo,
        and Lynx.
      </p>
      <p>
        I love Javascript, and think it's fun sometimes, but I'd much rather
        have a page that's easily accessible to everyone, regardless of their
        computing power and living situation.
      </p>
      <p>
        I have added a light and dark mode, implemented entirely using symbolic
        links. No need for javascript, cookies, or server side page processing!
        The only difference is which CSS file is symlinked to. The light CSS
        hides the light mode button, and the dark CSS hides the dark mode
        button.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you want to contact me, my e-mail address can be found on my GitLab
        or GitHub account page. If you have questions, comments, or even want
        to hire me, don't hesitate to get in touch!
