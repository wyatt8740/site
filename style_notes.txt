Whichever file gets linked to style.css will become the default style.
New styles can be added by using stylegen.sh, although I have to manually add
the buttons still. Could almost definitely automate that.

The HTML is the same across both currently usable styles. In fact, those html
files are just symlinks to the base ones. RIP, Windows users.
