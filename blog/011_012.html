        A good friend of mine with a passion for pixel art has long had a
        fascination with old Japanese domestic computers, especially the NEC
        PC-9801 series. This started me on another deep dive into things I
        didn't understand, but which I now want to document and help others
        to discover.

      <p>
        I've always been more of a Sharp X68000 person, myself. Not because
        there's anything <i>wrong</i> with the 98, though!&ndash; the X68000 is
        just a much more powerful computer if you are interested in playing
        games, with much stronger graphical capabilities in most respects than
        its competition.
      </p>
      <p>
        Unfortunately, the X68000 has a few problems if you're looking to
        obtain one in 2023:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          It was only ever sold in Japan (obviously).
        </li>
        <li>
          It needs a 24KHz horizontal scan rate monitor, which almost
          nothing in the US does (even VGA flat screens).</li>
        <li>
          A lot of them have bad surface mount capacitors that leak
          out and destroy their circuitry. This is especially apparent with
          the later, more-powerful ones. Pretty much the same problem all
          Sega Game Gears seem to have.</li>
        <li>
          Almost all documentation is in Japanese&hellip; I am trying to learn
          Japanese, but it's like being thrown in the ocean to learn to swim.
        </li>
        <li>
          A lot of the documentation isn't scanned. I'm guessing this is
          some sort of fear about copyright law and the way it is enforced
          in Japan?
        </li>
        <li>
          It was always the underdog computer in the market, and never sold
          as well as its competitors. It also has a fiercely loyal fan-base
          today. Prices are sky-high (perhaps in part because no one is
          satisfied with just one X68000 and they need to have <i>at least
          one</i> of every model).
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        &hellip;Hey, wait a moment. Haven't I seen this somewhere before?
      </p>
      <div class="imgcontain imgwrap" id="a4000_prices">
        <a href="pc9801_1/full/a4000_prices.png">
          <img src="pc9801_1/a4000_prices.png"
               alt="Amiga 4000 prices on ebay, $3000 plus."/>
        </a>
        <div class="imgwrap caption imgcentercaption">
          The X68000 seems to be pretty much analogous to what the Amiga became here.<br/>
          I'd rather buy a decent used car, personally.
        </div>
      </div>
      <p>
        So basically, much like with Amigas, the continual interest in the
        platform from people with more money than I have has ensured that I've
        written off being able to afford and justify getting an X68000 in the
        near future, barring incredible luck. But I'm still interested in
        Japanese computers; there are a lot of weird designs out there that are
        intriguing to me, and some of them look absolutely <i>gorgeous</i>.
      </p>

          The Sharp X1. I wish any of my computers looked this good!
        </div>
      </div>
      <p>
        I briefly had considered an X1, which looks stunning, and would also be
        able to run CP/M. But unfortunately (again), there's not much I think I
        would actually <i>do</i> on one, no matter how beautiful it would look
        on my desk. Maybe if I can find a good thing to do on it some day, I'll
        return to thinking about it. The monitor would be pricey, I bet, but
        the X1 computer itself regularly shows up for pretty fair prices
        online, even in red (the objective best color for it).
      </p>
      <h3>Some Reasons NOT to Buy a Japanese Computer</h3>
      <p>
        So, basically, I'd been considering getting into Japanese computers for
        some time, but never following through. Even ignoring the initial cost
        at auction, the shipping fees would be murder on top of that&hellip; and
        there are all sorts of other considerations that I'd have to make when
        buying one, as well, to actually be able to use it here. For instance,
        what kinds of floppies will they use? Do I want to use real floppies,
        or Gotek-style floppy drive hardware emulators and disk images? How
        will i connect a hard drive? How do I actually <i>power</i> the thing?
        What kind of software can I practically use on it? What kind of screen
        do I need?
      </p>
      <p>
        As you might be able to see, it quickly becomes a logistical nightmare
        and a money pit. I'd experienced some of this with my Amiga 500, but
        was lucky enough to get mine with a correct monitor and hard drive and
        power supplies included in the sale at a really nice price, locally,
        with no shipping fees. But I'd still felt the need to upgrade to a newer
        hard drive and caused endless SCSI headaches in the process. I'd
        upgraded the RAM, added a Genlock to subtitle laserdiscs, put in an ECS
        (enhanced) version of its "Denise" chip to enable higher resolutions,
        added a Kickstart (bootloader ROM) switcher to let me boot newer
        versions of Amiga Workbench (the OS), and all sorts of other things to
        better use it. All of that stuff adds up fast! And to do the same on
        a Japanese computer, many of those purchases would include paying
        shipping fees from about halfway across the planet whenever I ran into
        a new problem that needed a hardware solution.
      </p>
      <h3>Why I Still Ended Up Getting a Japanese Computer Anyway</h3>
      <p>
        So, knowing all of this would happen, and that it'd be a massive money
        pit, why did I decide to follow through, eventually?
      </p>
      <p>
        Well, basically, it was because of my aforementioned good friend with
        the pixel art passion.
      </p>
      <h2>The NEC PC-9801</h2>
      <h3>Why Do People Get the PC-9801?</h3>
      <p>
        My aforementioned good friend had long been enamored specifically with
        the NEC PC-9801 and its descendants. To be completely honest, the PC-98
        has some games with good artwork and stuff, but it was the <i>least</i>
        interesting of the major Japanese platforms to me. It was the one that
        sold the best, and it wasn't <i>particularly</i> speedy or performant.
        It also used x86 CPU's, which means it was the most "IBM-Like" of the
        big platforms, alongside Fujitsu's "FM Towns" line. But the FM Towns
        had more interesting graphical capabilities for playing games and
        multimedia. The draw for the PC-98, for people interested in games,
        seems to be one of three things these days.

          NEC PC-9801.

      <ol>
        <li>
          Touhou, a "bullet hell" type shooter game series featuring cutesy
          manga/anime style girl characters which started on the PC-98
          platform. I'd say that (at least from what people <i>say</i> online
          and the frequency with which they say it) this one franchise
          accounts for maybe 40% of the gaming interest in the platform,
          both inside and outside of Japan. The Touhou franchise is still
          ongoing, so that's probably a large part of why it has stayed
          popular while everything else is forgotten.
        </li>
        <li>
          Early PC-98 era computer games, aimed at a general audience. Later
          in the system's lifetime, most people interested in computer games
          moved to other platforms. This means either to game consoles like
          the Famicom, Super Famicom, Mega Drive, and so on, or to other
          computer platforms like the aforementioned X68000 (which had some
          <i>excellent</i> arcade ports) or the FM Towns. Some games in this
          category of early general audience games for PC-98 include some
          great RPG's you may or may not have heard of, such as:
          <ul>
            <li>
              Falcom's <i>Ys</i> franchise, which survives to this day.
            </li>
            <li>
              Glodia's <i>Emerald Dragon</i>, which has a translation on the
              SNES version&hellip; but I like the art on the PC-98 version the
              most.
            </li>
          </ul>
          I'd say that this interest accounts for maybe 5% of the
          outside-of-Japan interest in the system, and I'd guess maybe 15-25%
          of the interest <i>within</i> Japan.
        </li>
        <li>
          Finally, I can't just dance around it forever, so it's best to just
          address it here. Later in the system's lifetime it became a staple
          for visual novels and erotic games (abbreviated as <i>eroge</i>).
          It was very well suited to this, since even though its actual
          performance at animating things on the screen was rather poor, it
          could display somewhat high resolution static graphics in a fair
          number of colors. So it was ideal for visual novels. I'd guess that
          internationally this is 60% of the interest and in Japan it's about
          35% of the interest.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        Additionally, there may be some more interest if someone wants to run
        Linux or similar on it, since buying a domestic 486 PC is not
        significantly less expensive anymore.
      </p>
      <p>
        To be honest, the visual novel and eroge element probably is what
        interests me the <i>least</i> of the above about the 98; I am
        interested most in the computer RPG's that we never got here, both as a
        way to learn some Japanese and because I enjoy the art styles. I played
        a small portion of the English translation of the SNES version of
        'Emerald Dragon,' and it looks like it might be really, really good
        storywise. I also have played an emulated version of 'Ys' and I
        <i>loved</i> the soundtrack (which was composed by Yuzo Koshiro, who
        later did the music for <i>Streets of Rage</i> and is often considered
        a master of frequency modulation synthesis music).
      </p>
      <p>
        Sure, there are a handful of visual novel-esque games that I would
        really like to play, though. Hideo Kojima's acclaimed <i>Snatcher</i>
        comes to mind, for instance. But that had a Sega CD port (in English,
        I might add), so why not just play that?!
      </p>
      <h3>Why Did <i>I</i> Get the PC-9801?</h3>
      <h4>(The Influence of Friendship On Financial Decisions)</h4>
      <p>
        In the end, the primary reason i was interested now was because of my
        friend, who has less technical background than I do but who has strong
        interest in learning - not just about the PC-98, but about computing
        and old electronics in general. She has wanted a PC-98 for a long time,
        and asked for my help in figuring out what to get and how to set it up.
      </p>
      <p>
        I decided that it might be fun for me to get one, too, so we could
        figure stuff out together. And such were the mental gymnastics I did to
        get into a buying mood. It also is a somewhat smaller investment than
        an X68000, and with a LOT more supply available for sale in both
        computers and the parts for them, with less intense demand.
      </p>
      <p>
        I have already had a <i>lot</i> of fun teaching my friend and watching
        her gain more confidence with electronics. It seems to have been
        something she had wanted to get into for some time, but didn't know
        where to begin. Having been there myself, I suppose I took some
        sympathy. My desire to share what I've learned with others
        also kicked in, since sharing what I've learned is what I live for.
        Coupled with my own shelved (out of practicality) curiosity about these
        platforms. It simply felt like it might finally be the right time.
      </p>
      <p>
        We had talked a lot about older computers in the past, and I expressed
        that I was somewhat familiar with the Japanese computer platforms, at
        least in theory. And it seemed like a fun thing that we could do
        together. So far, it actually has been, although there have been a few
        bumps in the road. I'll hopefully get around to explaining what exactly
        those bumps are soon. At any rate, I had to start researching the
        PC-9801 series in earnest to prepare us for our respective purchases.
      </p>
      <p>
        And so, without further ado, I bring you&hellip;

      <h2 id="pc9801_buying_wyatt_guide_top">Wyatt's PC-9801 Buyer and User Guide</h2>
      <p>
        First off, let's address something very basic but of <b><i>absolutely
        critical</i></b> importance for understanding fully what you are about
        to get yourself into, and how deep you can expect to get into it.
      </p>
      <h3 id="pc9801_buying_wyatt_not_an_ibm_clone">The PC-9801 is NOT an IBM Clone! </h3>
      <p>
        If you came here looking for info on the PC-98 series, and aren't just
        casually reading my blog, then you should already know this&ndash; but
        the NEC PC-9801 and its descendants are <i>not</i> just fancier IBM
        PC's. They <i>do</i> have some similarities, on account of their
        chipsets, but if you want to run programs written for an IBM that
        does <b>ANY</b> BIOS calls or direct hardware access, you can expect
        that it might not run on a PC-98. If it only uses MS-DOS/PC-DOS API's,
        though, then you might be fine.
      </p>
      <p>
        For starters,, <b>don't just expect that you can install your American
        copy of MS-DOS on a PC-98 and have it work. It will <i>not</i> work. You
        will also have to be able to figure out how to use DOS in Japanese;
        this is most probably totally unavoidable.</b> Things that have been
        unofficially translated for the PC-98 is <b>quite scarce</b> compared
        to all of the impressive accomplishments that have been made by ROM
        hackers and fan translators for game consoles and newer Windows games.
      </p>
      <p>
        Here are some of the hardware and software architectural differences
        between the PC-9801 and IBM-compatibles (known as DOS/V systems in
        Japan) that I have encountered so far, in list form.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Incompatible keyboard protocol and connector</b>:
          <ul>
            <li>No equivalents outside of Japan, except <b>perhaps</b> for

      <p>
        So, ya really want to learn about the PC-9801, do ya? Well, first, what
        do you want to do with yours? - depending on your answers to the below
        questions, some models may be preferable over others.
      </p>
      <p>
        Since there was never a "PC-98 building industry" to my knowledge,
        given the proprietary nature of the platform, you will have to settle
        for an OEM-made machine. This makes choosing the correct one for your
        needs even more important, since it's much less likely you can just
        pop something out of a socket and upgrade it later (on many models).
        Many have soldered-down CPU's, for instance, which obviously precludes
        most people from being able to upgrade them.
      </p>
      <p>
        The PSU's are similarly designed for the power budget of the machine as
        it came configured, with some overhead for cards. The connectors are
        not necessarily going to be standardized, and I doubt that most will
        accept an AT or ATX PSU. So if you want to upgrade your PSU, you may
        end up having to hunt for a related model that came from the factory
        with a beefier PSU to steal parts from - or perhaps you will be able
        to do a custom wiring job, if you're confident with that, and make
        some other PSU work.
      </p>
      <p>
        Finally, even if something looks like a standard connector, don't take
        that for granted. Do your research first! Don't just assume the best
        of all possible worlds, where everything works with everything, because
        I think it's safe to say we aren't in Kansas anymore.

          (Yes! - There's a
          <a href="./007_008.html#bubblegum-review-1">Bubblegum Crisis</a>
          game on the PC-9801!)
        </div>
      </div>
      <p>
        Regarding the above picture, Bubblegum Crisis is actually an example of
        a game where the system you choose matters. The game uses FM sound, so
        it needs to be new enough for that, and it also makes no attempt to
        throttle itself to match the framerate of the screen - it just runs at
        full-tilt all the time, so you have to be able to make the computer run
        slow enough for it to be playable. It's comically fast at 50 MHz.
      </p>
      <h4>DOS, Windows, or Other?</h4>
      <p>
        If you intend to get a PC-98 and run Windows programs on it, you can
        basically treat it as an IBM-compatible PC running that version of
        Windows, except with a Japanese locale. I see little reason to do this,
        unless you really want a 486 running Windows but don't like the prices
        on IBM-compatible 486'es.
      </p>
      <p>
        It has also been said by many that the 98 series lost its "98-ness" in
        the mid 90's with the rise of Windows, as the computers moved away from
        the old µPD7220-derived design to using third-party GPU's that were
        more adept at accelerating 2D window management operations. These
        graphics chips were things made by companies like S3, and stripped away
        another bit of uniqueness from the series. Later models also introduced
        features like PCI card slots. The PC-98 series rapidly moved towards
        being just a "Windows PC," compatible with win16/win32 programs made
        for IBM-compatible Wintel machines. DOS compatibility still existed to
        an extent, but the further away NEC moved, the more stuff began to
        break in DOS-land, where direct hardware access was still king.
      </p>
      <p>
        Thus, it seems that the PC-98 might have been one of the last
        non-IBM-compatible, non-Apple consumer personal computer series to
        survive in any form. But if you want to run Windows, why not just run
        Windows on an IBM-compatible...?
      </p>
      <p>
        In my personal opinion, the real reasons one should want a PC-9801 are
        some combination of game software, potentially learning Japanese, and
        maybe running free operating systems like the BSD's or Linux distros.
        There is very little attractive about the machines for plain old
        Windows use. In my case I keep a Gateway E-3200 (Pentium 3) around for
        my old Windows software use. It runs US English Windows 98 and Japanese
        Windows 2000, and packs a Voodoo3 GPU; this puts me in a good spot for
        anything I might really want to play in the Windows world, since I'm
        not really too interested in modern Windows games.
      </p>
      <h4>You Have Selected: DOS</h4>
      <p>
        I will just assume you can take a hint and realized that above I was
        essentially saying that DOS is the only real choice here for games, if
        you don't want your computer to be "just another old Windows PC."
      </p>
      <p>
        The rest of this article will probably not focus on Windows much, if at
        all.
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <h3 id="pc9801_buying_wyatt_what_are_my_options">What are My Options for Hardware, then?</h3>
      <p>
        I stumbled my way into my choice based on a combination of factors.
        First of all, as mentioned above, I wanted it to be viable for DOS
        games. I also wanted it to be new enough to be able to run the same
        things my friend was running, which are largely from the era where the
        games don't look quite "8-bit" anymore and the pixel art can be more
        intricate. I also wanted it to be capable of FM sound (Yamaha YM2203 or
        YM2608). These chips have a lot in common with the YM2612 chip used in
        the Sega Mega Drive/Genesis consoles. I also desired expandability,
        the ability to use a hard drive, and to be honest I sort of wanted
        to do something no one else was doing.
      </p>
      <p>
        So, if you want a PC-98 for DOS, and you don't want to buy one for
        early games and another for late games, I'd say a 486 or 386 is the
        ideal range to choose from. Circa perhaps 1990 to 1994. You can find a
        list of a whole bunch of machines
        <a href="https://pc-9800.net/">on this site</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        First, I helped my friend to choose something. She already kind of
        knew what she wanted, so all I really had to do was cross reference
        the models she talked about with the ones on that site to check for
        red flags.
      </p>
      <h4>PC-9801 or PC-9821?</h4>
      <p>
        The PC-9801 was the original series of computers. The best way to
        describe the differences might just be to show how the PC-9801 and
        PC-9821 lines tended to differ.
      </p>
      <p>
        This distinction is for the most part illusory. There are certain
        things correlated with one series or the other, and the original
        target markets for the two lines were different, but being badged
        a "PC-9821" originally was supposed to signify that it was
        "Windows-ready" and better for multimedia, as far as I can tell.
        Some PC-9821's were still sold with just MS-DOS installed and
        without hard drives, so 9821 does not necessarily mean "Windows"
        in all cases.
      </p>
      <h4>9821:</h4>
      <p>
        The PC-9821 models came out targetted at use by Windows users, and have
        some quality of life improvements. For instance, to change settings on a
        PC-9801, you flip a bunch of DIP switches and need to have documentation
        to discover what they do (they are not necessarily marked on the board).
        But with the 9821, by holding the 'HELP' key while booting, you can
        enter a software configurator which shows you virtual dip switches that
        you can flip, with inline help text describing what each switch is
        doing. It can be a real time saver.
      </p>
      <p>
        The 9821 line also usually has different floppy disk drives - from what
        I can gather, the 9801 series usually had 5.25" and the 9821 usually
        had 3.5". Since 3.5" floppies are a LOT easier to come by in good
        shape, and just generally age a little better, that may be one reason
        to consider using a PC-9821 if you intend to keep the original floppy
        drives.
      </p>
      <p>
        It should be noted that <i>on the PC-98</i>, it is possible to write
        any PC-98 5.25" floppy disk image to a 3.5" floppy disk and it will
        work (if the computer and drive both can handle the density/coercivity
        of the media). You may have to reformat the disk first if using a
        western market disk, but 'ufiformat' on Linux can do it. This is to
        say, the PC-98 treats 3.5" floppy drives as just miniaturized 5.25"
        drives, with the same numbers of tracks and sectors as a 5.25" disk.
        Later ones (mostly 9821's) can also support 1.44MB formatted
        high density disks, but most software was distributed on 1.2MB disks.
      </p>
      <p>
        A 9821 is also much more likely to come with an IDE hard disk drive,
        or at least with a controller and connector for one. Typically, with
        a 9801, you need to use a SCSI controller and SCSI drives to get large
        storage capabilities. I personally struggle to make SCSI do what I want
        sometimes, and documentation on many PC-98 SCSI controllers seems
        relatively poor, so that might be another argument for using a 9821.
      </p>
      <p>
        As will be seen below, there is one major reason apart from CPU speed
        (and even more important than CPU speed, arguably) not to get most
        9821 models: western graphics accelerator chipsets for Windows which
        are not entirely compatible with DOS games written with the uPD7220
        and its evolutions in mind. Some may work, some may not. Read on.
      </p>
      <h4>9801:</h4>
      <p>
        The 9801's were intended to be DOS machines; it may be easier to find a
        low-powered one, and it will <i>definitely</i> be easier to find one
        without a window accelerator GPU built-in. They seem to be generally
        less desirable than the early 9821's. Also, this is just something I
        have heard, but people say it's harder to open up the earlier 9801's
        (although later ones are probably pretty okay).
      </p>
      <h3>Yeah, But What Does All of That Mean?</h3>
      <p>
        I threw around a lot of terms describing the differences between the
        9801 and 9821. To elaborate a little, here's some more detailed
        explanations of what you should try to look for or avoid.
      </p>
      <h4>Red Flag #1: Leaking Real-Time Clock (RTC) Battery</h4>
      <p>
        The one reason I hesitate at all to suggest buying an untested PC-98 is
        that some of them use Nickel-Cadmium (NiCad) real time clock batteries.
        Every system with one of those should be treated as a time bomb, if
        not already dead. Those NiCad battery barrels seem to be more common
        in older stuff. But they are mounted to the motherboard, so when they
        leak out, they start corroding the copper traces away. If it's not
        caught quickly and treated/cleaned, it can and will kill motherboards.
        If you're not sure which kind of battery a particular model uses,
        proceed with caution.
      </p>

        </a>
        <div class="imgwrap caption imgcentercaption">
          My Commodore Amiga A501 memory expansion board - another victim of
          clock NiCad battery leakage.<br/>
          Oftentimes with old computers, the battery is on the motherboard itself, and it takes the motherboard with it.
        </div>
      </div>
      <p>
        If your system has a barrel battery, I suggest IMMEDIATELY
        clipping/removing it from the board, buying a new battery cell, and
        mounting it in a holder attached to the motherboard via a wire. If there
        was leakage but the board still works, you should polish off the area
        of leakage (down to good copper), use a little alcohol, and then re-seal
        it with nail polish or something similar.
      </p>
      <p>
        It's worth noting that not all RTC batteries are NiCads. I've also seen
        rechargeable coin cell batteries, which seem to be much more reliable.
      </p>
      <p>
        The ones that my friend got ended up not having barrel batteries, but
        I believe the PC-98DO has one and lots of others besides also do.
      </p>
      <h4>Red Flag #2: Integrated window accelerator graphics chip</h4>
      <p>
        Onboard window accelerator cards are for making Windows run with nice
        effects, like showing the contents of windows while dragging them
        around. Unfortunately, these machines force you to use that graphics
        chipset; there's no way to just "unplug" it and go back to using
        the old µPD7220 derivatives. So my friend needed to rule out
        <i>most</i> of the PC-9821 line. <b>But</b>, some of the early ones
        still had either no GPU card built in, or else simply had an
        accelerator card pre-installed that could easily be popped out.
      </p>
      <h4>Red Flag #3: No FM sound</h4>
      <p>
        Some later systems omitted the FM sound, especially laptop PC-98
        models. We didn't look at the laptop models in much detail, though,
        since my friend very clearly expressed that she wanted a desktop model.
        Early models lacking FM sound are far too old to be able to play any
        but the oldest PC-98 DOS games at a decent speed.
      </p>
      <p>
        There are two main kinds of FM sound chips to consider; the "26-Sound"
        and "86-Sound." If your system has 26-sound, it's much better than
        nothing, but be forewarned that you might still end up springing for a
        PC-9801-86 sound card board if you want stereo sound, PCM audio
        playback, or Atari-style joystick compatibility. And that card on its
        own seems to cost upwards of $100 USD. So factor that in when ordering.
      </p>
      <p>
        The PC-9801-26K card is a cheaper option, but still over $50 plus
        shipping. And if your machine isn't new enough to have an integrated
        26K, then it may be too weak for most <i>later</i> DOS games
        graphically and processor-wise.
      </p>

        Some 9821's (most, if not all, actually) have the "86 Sound" (YM2608)
        built-in. On these systems, you can connect a joystick to the system
        via an adapter that plugs into the keyboard port. I might add a
        diagram for this at some point, but basically you need to ground
        one or two wires and then hook the remaining pins up to the joystick
        inputs. People on yahoo auctions will sell you pre-made adapter cables,
        and I didn't have too much trouble finding instructions for making one.
        I am also feeling kind of lazy at the moment, given how much devotion
        I am putting into just writing this article as it is. The VGA adapter
        diagram elsewhere in this post took over an hour to research, draw, and
        make it look all nice in the page. So did the other mouse adapter one.

      <h4>Red Flag #4: No CD Drive</h4>
      <p>
        This isn't an instant "NEVER buy this" or anything, but if you don't
        have a CD drive built in, you may have to add one via a SCSI
        controller card for some games. So be sure to factor in that additional
        cost, if having a CD drive actually matters to you.
      </p>
      <p>
        People have been doing work on adding CD digital audio (CDDA) playback
        to solutions like SCSI2SD (ZuluSCSI), but as of my writing this it
        seems most if not all existing ZuluSCSI boards do not have the
        necessary hardware wired up for audio output, so there is still value
        in a physical CD drive, even beyond it just "feeling right" - but
        if you don't need music via CD playback, then ZuluSCSI boards can
        emulate a data CD drive, which is enough for installing something like
        Windows 98 or some games.
      </p>
      <h4>Red Flag #5: There is no Red Flag #5</h4>
      <p>
        If you avoid a window accelerator built into the motherboard, and your
        system has FM sound built in (especially a YM2608, for "86-Sound"),
        you have already ensured that your system will be at least largely
        compatible with most older DOS things. If you have a CD drive and
        a non-leaked (or coin cell) clock battery, that's even better.
      </p>
      <p>
        I guess I could say "dirty computers are less likely to be good than
        ones that look well cared for," or that "rusty computers are a red
        flag," but it really depends on where the rust is and the extent of the
        rust. There are other things I might be able to say, too, but I can't
        think of them offhandedly and the above are the HUGE ones.
      </p>
      <p>
        I might just add that you shouldn't be dependent on the hard drive
        (if yours is sent with one) still working. Have contingency plans.

      <h2 id="pc9801_buying_wyatt_what_my_friend_bought">What My Friend Bought (and Her Experiences)</h2>
      <p>
        My friend chose to get two systems, a PC-9821 Cs2 and a PC-9821 Ce2.
        I believe the idea was that if something was broken, she'd be able to
        swap parts to get at least one system working fully. It ended up being
        a good thing that she did get two, which I also intend to talk about
        in detail later, but for now suffice to say one of the floppy drives
        was unreliable and one of the CD drives didn't work. There was also
        another little incident after arrival that made it doubly good that she
        had both systems. More on that later.

        Pssh. That's so <i>mainstream</i>. I can do better than that.
      </p>
      <p>
        Sorry for the misdirection! - There was actually a <i>third</i> option
        (beyond the 9801 and the 9821) which I purposefully neglected to
        mention. The moral is, don't let people like me make you believe that
        only what we're presenting are options! Even if I don't mean badly, I
        could simply be misinformed or underinformed. I highly suggest not
        leaning just on one or two people's buying guides. There's probably
        a lot I'm leaving out, just like others have left things out of theirs.

        Of course, if you discover errors or oversights, or have more to share,

        It covers a few of the requirements above, but also lacks a fair number

        Seiko Epson made PC-98 compatible clone computers in the 1980's and
        1990's. It seems to be the only company that ever did, strangely
        enough... apparently, other companies considered it but were
        worried about the loss of reputation that would be involved. And
        NEC definitely was hostile to the idea of competition; they locked
        Epsons out from using its versions of DOS and some of its PC-98
        expansion cards in software.

        I was able to do a little research before buying mine, and there was
        plenty of talk about the Epsons on the web (in Japanese) and I did not
        find a single mention of incompatibility other than in that NEC itself
        added "Epson checks" to some of its cards' boot ROM's and to some
        versions of NEC's MS-DOS variant for the 98 series that would make
        the computers fail to boot (an act of blatant anticompetitive sabotage,

        Anyway, back on topic: Without access to an NEC machine, it's hard to
        know if the few problems I've had are compatibility issues or not, but
        when my friend with the NEC-brand computers has time I'll ask her to
        try running some of my software and we'll see. But I can affirm that
        pretty much everything works; just some of the older software has some
        glitches which to me seems consistent with my expectations. My unit has
        enhanced graphical capabilities compared to early or mid-80's models,
        and I suspect that my problems are simply a result of the upgraded
        hardware and that mine is in fact "bug-compatible" with the 486-class
        NEC computers.
      </p>
      <p>
        There are also some ways that it might be considered to be <i>more</i>
        compatible than NEC's from its era. Check this out.

        To my knowledge, no NEC PC-98s ever had a turbo button or physical
        switch, although some could be configured upon boot or internally with
        DIP switches. I can change the speed at <i>any time</i>, and have
        already gotten great use out of this feature.
      </p>
      <h3>Expansion Cards</h3>
      <p>
        My PC does not have an IDE or SCSI controller built in, although some
        variants of it did come with one. There's an unused card edge slot in
        the case that can be hooked to a proprietary Epson card, which I
        believe uses SCSI and also houses a hard drive in a metal cage
        alongside it. I didn't see one on Yahoo Auctions, but did see that they
        have sold on there once in a while in the past.
      </p>
      <p>
        That's not a deal-breaker, because there's also C-Bus, which is the
        also-proprietary, but-at-least-publicly-documented slot NEC put on
        the PC-98 series for end-user expansions. C-Bus SCSI controllers exist
        and can be used to boot a hard drive, even on computers where a
        proprietary hard drive interface is also provided. Mine came with one,
        although I had trouble making it work. I have a feeling it was a
        termination issue, since it looks to only have passive termination on
        it.
      </p>
      <p>
        There's a fair bit of configuration that many cards require to be done
        via DIP switches. I sort of understand this, since the main thing to
        do is ensure that no cards have overlapping addresses or interrupts,
        but sometimes the finer points elude me. It would be a good idea to
        take a picture of any cards you get before you start messing with the
        switches so you can restore to the configuration it came to you in.
      </p>
      <p>
        One interesting thing to note about these cards that I have not seen
        mentioned in the English speaking world yet is that the little plastic
        tab on some cards which presses a switch next to the slot to indicate
        that the card should be treated as a 24-bit addressable card instead of
        a 20-bit addressable one. If I understand correctly.

          Note the plastic doohickey on two of these cards. This presses down a
          switch that is present in some PC-98 models.
        </div>
      </div>
      <p>
        Apparently some later 24-bit addressable cards don't have the button
        presser anymore, and some later 9821s don't have the switch installed
        on all slots but just assume a card is 24-bit addressable if it is
        present. I swapped a 'button presser' onto the card closest to the
        camera from the one in the middle and behavior did not seem to change,
        but the card closest to the camera did already have a spot for me to
        screw the lever thing into it, so it was clearly designed with the
        intent of using one at some point.
      </p>
      <p>
        Don't peel those stickers off the brown chips, by the way. Those cover
        up EPROM (Erasable Programmable Read-Only Memory) quartz windows, and
        if exposed to the right light frequencies (somewhere in the ultraviolet
        range) the chip will be erased and the card won't operate properly.
        If you happen to have an EPROM programmer and the correct pin adapters,
        it'd be really great of you to dump the cards' ROMs and share them,
        too, because they could lose their data naturally even without light
        exposure at some point and need reprogramming. I sort of doubt the
        manufacturers care enough or even have the files (if the still exist)
        to help you out. Once the chips have lost their marbles, it's too late,
        unless someone's made a backup and can re-program them.
      </p>
      <p>
        I'll give a brief description of what my cards do, now.
      </p>
      <h4>Logitec LHA-301 SCSI Controller</h4>
      <p>
        This card is the SCSI card I actually use with my system. I had to buy
        it separately; the PC did not come with this card from the previous
        owner. They had the TEAC IF-55TB installed, which I could not get to
        work reliably, so I replaced it.
      </p>
      <p>
        It uses a "half-sized amphenol" (mini-centronics) connector, which is
        not a common SCSI connector here in the States but which seems to have
        been rather popular with Japanese manufacturers instead of the "HD50"
        miniaturized D-sub that most stuff seems to have used here. The
        LHA-301<b>A</b> uses a more common HD50 connector, but I did not see
        one for sale, and after reading descriptions of various SCSI controller
        options online the 301 and 301A seemed like some of my best bets. They
        even support "PnP" ("plug-n-play") in Windows, and support up through
        Windows 2000. If I upgrade the BIOS ROM (not sure how exactly to do
        that) from 1.05 to 1.07, it seemingly can support up to 8GB SCSI
        drives. It also supports three data transfer methods for interacting
        with the host system: PIO (the simplest, where the CPU is involved with
        every byte read in), DMA (direct memory access, which bypasses the CPU
        and writes directly to addresses in RAM so the CPU can work on other
        things), and SMIT (I have <i>absolutely no idea</i> what this is,
        but it seems to be the consensus of Japanese documentation I've
        found that it's faster than both DMA and PIO). I have mine configured
        for DMA right now and haven't had issues. I think there may be a DOS
        driver I need to install to actually make use of it, but I haven't done
        so, since I haven't felt too throttled by disk I/O yet and am just
        glad it's working so stably right now.
      </p>
      <p>
        I had to switch it out of "MO" (magneto-optical?) mode in order to make
        the DOS installer see and initialize it properly - I guess maybe a past
        owner was using it with a magneto-optical drive. The 130mm ones seem
        pretty cool. But I'm not getting one right now! - I've spent enough on
        this thing as it is!
      </p>
      <p>
        This card has a software-based configurator (accessed by holding
        ctrl+grph+L during boot) instead of DIP switches; I think it's really
        nifty. It also <i>actually works</i> for me (as opposed to the
        IF-55TB), which is also pretty nifty. From what I can see, the
        difference might be that the 55TB doesn't seem to have a voltage
        regulator on board, which is a prerequisite for active SCSI bus
        termination (the better kind). If I have an active terminator on one
        end and a passive resistor pack terminator on the other, that might
        explain why it behaves erratically.
      </p>
      <p>
        There's one thing it can't do, which is the PC-98's "Hi-Res"
        mode, which requires things to be at different addresses. I don't think
        this mode ever got much use, and later Windows-era machines had a
        different, incompatible solution for higher-resolution display. Since
        I don't know what I'd use it for, it doesn't bother me yet.
      </p>
      <h3>Things You Can Do While Your PC-98 is Being Shipped</h3>
      <p>
        So excited you can't sit still? Need to do something during the
        torturous wait for the day the huge expensive box arrives at your door?
      </p>

        Well, lucky you. There's a lot you still need to have ready besides the
        box itself.
      </p>
      <h4 id="pc9801_buying_wyatt_power_converters">Power Converters</h4>
      <p>
        At the risk of promoting FUD, I will point out/remind you that the
        Japanese power grid runs at 100 volts AC (at either 50 or 60 Hz).
        You shouldn't have to worry about frequency regardless of where you
        live, but if you aren't in Japan itself you <i>may</i> want to or
        need to invest in a step-down power transformer.        
      </p>
      <p>
        Japan's mains voltage is the lowest in the world, and it is the only
        country that uses this voltage. It's close enough to the US power
        grid's 110, 115, or 120 volts (seemingly depending on who you ask, the
        specific year, and several other details). It seems that the standard
        is now 120 volts, but that prior to sometime in the 1970's most regions
        used 110 to 115 volts. Regardless, we now use 120 volts, which is of
        course 20% higher than the power supply in your PC-98 was designed and
        rated for use with.
      </p>
      <p>
        This <i>might</i> be fine, and if it is it would certainly save you
        some money if you live in a &lt;=120V country. But your computer's
        power supply would at a minimum run hotter than it was expected to
        by the engineers who designed it, and at worst have a reduced service
        life or cause some somewhat low-rated capacitor to pop (remember that
        electrolytic capacitors often have huge margins of error on them on the
        magnitude of 20%). I'm guessing that a respectable company like NEC
        would not have used the bare minimum capacitor ratings, but these
        caps are still old unless you replace them, and a nice Japanese-made
        step-down transformer can be had for $100 or less to remove some of
        the nervousness that I would have plugging it in directly.
      </p>
      <p>
        If your PSU happens to have text on the back stating that it is rated
        for at least your voltage, then ignore everything I just said. But
        my Epson at least only specifies 100V at 50 or 60 Hz.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you are in Europe, you will almost certainly have to get a step-down
        transformer, unless there's some industrial PSU for PC-98's used
        with something like CNC machines that I'm unaware of and your
        machine came from somewhere like that rather than from Japan.
      </p>
      <p>
        I went a little pricier with mine and bought a used Sanyo TSD-N11LU
        transformer, with a nice "capacity indicator" and a rating of
        1100 Volt-Amps (not QUITE the same as saying 11 watts, in this case,
        apparently, but I don't know why that is. ) If your PC, monitor, and
        anything else Japanese that you are running off of your transformer
        totals less than the rated wattage, you should be fine. To be safe, I
        recommend going significantly higher than the minimum; things like hard
        drives draw a lot of power draw at spin-up, which might be fine for a
        short period of time, but I've seen stuff fail from excessive current
        draw when spinning up a bunch of disks before. I'd also just suggest
        trying not to stress your hardware, since it'll be expensive to ship
        more of it if you break it - assuming you can even find exactly your
        computer or whatever it is you are trying to replace. It also provides
        future-proofing; part of my reason for going high was in case I ended
        up importing a CRT (which I did).
      </p>

        If you can find an isolation transformer, that's especially nice, since
        while heavy it means you don't have to worry about earth grounding it
        at the wall outlet.

      <h3 id="pc9801_buying_wyatt_mouse">Mouse</h3>
      <p>
        Did your PC come with a mouse? If not, you need to get one for a lot of
        newer software.
      </p>
      <h4>Mouse Card (Older Systems Only)</h4>
      <p>
        Older PC-98's might not have a mouse port, and for those you'd need
        to find a "bus mouse" card, I believe. This only applies to the ones
        made before around 1985. <a href="https://radioc.web.fc2.com/column/pc98bas/pc98kbdmouse_en.htm">
        This site</a> claims the PC-9801, the 9801E, 9801F, and 9801M models
        are the ones that need a mouse card.
      </p>
      <h4>Two Mouse Connectors</h4>
      <p>
        For later machines, you will probably have one of two possible
        connectors. The choices are a 9-pin D-Subminiature connector or a 9-pin
        mini-DIN connector. If you have the mini-DIN, it's the same pinout as a
        "Microsoft InPort" bus mouse for the US market, which is for mouses
        that connect via an ISA card. For this reason, searching ebay for
        a PC "bus mouse" can get you something electrically compatible with a
        PC-98. If it uses the D-Sub connector, you will need to make or get
        an adapter. I think the adapter will have to come from Japan, since
        <span class=".strike">to my knowledge no western PC's used a quadrature
        mouse with that specific pinout</span> the western mouses that
        seems to <i>possibly</i> share this pinout are
        <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20010802062315id_/https://www.cs.rochester.edu/~kparkins/pinouts.txt">
        the original Microsoft "Green Eyed" bus mouse and perhaps a handful of
        Logitech ones</a>. I am not sure if passive adapters for connecting
        newer bus mouses to these older cards were ever widespread in the west,
        since we seem to have moved away from them far sooner than they did in
        Japan.

        </div>
      </div>
      <p>
        It would sort of make sense if this pinout was chosen to match
        Microsoft's original mouse pinout, since NEC seemed to cooperate pretty
        closely with ASCII Corporation (which was basically Microsoft's
        Japanese arm).

        You could try to rewire an Amiga or Atari ST or AT&T
        6300 mouse (or other two-or-more-button quadrature mouse) and
        have it work. You could also
        <a href="http://oldcomputer.info/hacks/mouse/index.htm">try this guy's
        "universal bus mouse" idea,</a> and convert probably just about any old
        PS/2 ball mouse you might own into a bus mouse.
      </p>
      <p>
        I opted to buy a mini-DIN mouse, the Logitech PC-93-9MD, from someone
        in Texas and then ordered a mouse adapter from Japan, since I was in
        no hurry but my PC-98 has a D-sub mouse connector. I also decided
        I didn't want to wire up my own this time, since making something both
        small and durable is tough, and the cost of shipping parts from Digikey
        is almost as bad as just buying a used adapter from halfway across
        the planet unless you have other things you're buying at the same time.
      </p>
      <p> 
        Does that defeat the point of buying a mouse domestically...?
      </p>
      <p>
        Well, maybe.
      </p>
      <p>
        But the price of PC-98 mouse from Japan was nearly as much as the Texas
        mouse, even without shipping fees. So I think I may have come out ahead
        just due to how small of an envelope the mouse adapter could fit in.
        And this mouse had one more button than most of the Japanese ones! -
        although I'm not sure what all will use it.

      <h3 id="pc9801_buying_wyatt_monitor">Monitor</h3>
      <p>
        Your PC monitor may or may not work with the PC-98, as I have already
        alluded to. Its VGA connector almost certainly will not fit into the
        output on the PC-98, even if it is electrically compatible. Here is
        a drawing I made that corresponds to the adapters that I wired for
        myself and my friend.
      </p>
      <div class="imgcontain imgwrap" id="pc9801_buying_wyatt_vga_adapter_img">
        <a href="pc9801_1/vga_adapter.png">

        </a>
        <div class="imgwrap caption imgcentercaption">
          This is drawn as if the two connectors' solder sides are facing each
          other, wide side up. The physical wiring will look pretty similar in
          this situation.
        </div>
      </div>
      <p>
        I am not 100% sure the ground wiring is all correct, so if you get
        noise definitely look first at pins 12 and 8 on the DA15 side and
        pins 5 and 10 on the VGA side. Perhaps I need to separate them from
        each other?
      </p>
      <p>
        According to the VGA pinout on Wikipedia, pin 5 on the VGA connector
        is supposed to be the ground specifically for the HSync signal, and
        pin 10 for the VSync signal. So if you can figure out which is which
        on the DA15 (PC-98) side (if any), then perhaps that will reduce noise.
      </p>
      <p>
        It looks fine on my CRT, though, which is why I have not bothered to
        mess with it much. I followed the DA15 pinout from
        <a href="https://radioc.web.fc2.com/column/pc98bas/pc98dispout2_en.htm">here</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Of course, there's also a solid chance your monitor will not be able to
        sync to the PC-98's 24KHz mode. If yours is like this, but you happen to
        have one that can sync to 15KHz (like my Commodore 1942 CRT or my Dell
        U2410 LCD), you can see if there's a DIP switch to make it output at
        15KHz. On my Epson, this switch exists on the front panel and is
        labelled <b>"HS24K."</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        When I first got this Epson, I had not yet bought a CRT and was hoping
        my LCD would do the job. Since 24KHz is in between 15KHz and 31KHz, I
        was a little hopeful, and I wired up my adapter while I waited for it
        to arrive.
      </p>
      <p>
        When it got here, I got nothing. But I was able to confirm operation by
        switching that DIP switch on the front panel, which made it show up on
        the Dell. I don't recommend just leaving it there, because a lot of
        stuff will break or work weirdly. It's not really a tenable long-term
        solution. Also, it introduces "scaling artifacts" such as uneven pixel
        widths, and most stuff that uses the higher color modes will be cut off
        halfway down the screen.
      </p>
      <p>
        Anyway, that happened, so I needed to get a CRT or a scaler (or another
        LCD). I ended up going for a CRT.
      </p>
      <p>
        Unfortunately, not all PC-98 monitors can sync at 24KHz either. Some of
        the later Windows 9821 monitors will <i>not</i> and run at 480p minimum
        (around 31Khz).
      </p>
      <p>
        Many if not all Sharp X68000 screens will also do 24KHz and can be
        used, by the way. The X68000 appears to use a compatible connector,
        too. Not sure about FM Towns, though. That's something that might be
        worth researching.
      </p>
      <p>
        Make sure the monitor you are looking for has <b>analogue RGB</b>, not
        just digital. Many older monitors have only digital RGB, which will
        limit the number of colors and types of software you can use.
      </p>
      <p>
        Additionally, finding a nicely priced one will be challenging, and you
        probably <b>will</b> get murdered on shipping. I won mine in an auction
        for $30 and paid <b>nearly ten times that much in shipping</b>, which
        was an unexpected surprise to say the least. I'd thought it'd be maybe
        $150 or so to ship. Apparently, Buyee re-packs stuff after inspection
        if you choose to have them inspect it, so I am nearly certain that
        Buyee's packaging is the reason it cost so much. For that reason,
        I am considering Buyee alternatives in the future, but we'll see.
        It did at least arrive very well protected and intact. But for a
        monitor that I bought 'untested' looking absolutely <i>filthy</i>,
        I don't know if I would have spent that much more in shipping had
        I been given a choice to not repack it.
      </p>
      <p>
        Unfortunately, my friend had already snagged what seems to have been
        the only really nice monitor at a fair price on the site, so I was left
        to deal with either super overpriced stuff or stuff that wasn't
        guaranteed to actually work, or overpriced stuff that I would
        definitely have to repair.

      <p>
        I ended up deciding this filthy thing, an NEC PC-KD851 monitor, was my
        best bet for getting something that worked, since the seller said the
        screen would go bright when turned on or off. I operated under the
        principle that filthy untested stuff is more likely to be fine than
        spotless stuff that's tested and that the seller thinks is broken.
      </p>
      <p>
        To be honest, most stuff I pick up tends to be fine, and it probably
        wouldn't have been kept around long enough to get so filthy if it
        hadn't worked back in the day when it was presumably stored away.
      </p>
      <p>
        The thing came, and it took <b>hours</b> of scrubbing at it with a damp
        rag and/or alcohol soaked rag to get most of the grime off. But it

        The PC-KD851 was originally made for the PC-8801 series, it seems,
        rather than the 9801. Specifically, I've found a catalog scan that
        says it works with the PC-8801mkIISR, which indicates it's from around
        1985. But since it has an analogue RGB input, and since the 8801 also
        could output at 24KHz, I decided it had a good chance of being
        compatible. I think the seller also listed it as being PC-9801
        compatible, actually.
      </p>
      <p>
        The PC-KD861 appears to simply be a better version of the 851 that can
        also do 15 KHz. So I'd say that'd be one worth keeping an eye out for.
      </p>
      <p>
        Once again, this needed to be plugged into a stepdown transformer
        before I felt comfortable turning it on. Thankfully there's an outlet
        on the back of the Epson that I can use to daisy-chain it.
      </p>
      <h3>Floppy Drives: to Use or Replace?</h3>
      <p>
        Planning on using real floppy disks? You'll need some good diskettes.
        These are no longer being made, so you'll have to buy new old stock (or
        used, if you feel very lucky) - unless you already have some of course.
      </p>
      <p>
        Older PC-98's use DD (double density) diskettes and drives, and the
        drives can't reliably write to 1.44MB HD floppy disks which have lower
        coercivity, and need stronger magnetism to flip a bit from a zero to a one
        or vice versa. So if yours is an older model (before around 1993 or
        1994), you almost certainly need DD diskettes.
      </p>
      <p>
        It may also be a good idea to invest in a cleaning kit, or perhaps find
        a way to clean the drives without one. It only takes one bad disk to
        mess up a floppy drive and make it need a cleaning to avoid ruining
        good disks.
      </p>
      <p>
        I wish it were easier to keep using real ones, because I do happen to
        like using them... when they work.
      </p>
      <h3>FlashFloppy/HxC</h3>
      <p>
        Planning on forgoing floppy drives? You'll need to get some floppy
        drive emulators. A lot of games require that you have disks in two drives
        at once, so just one probably won't work, until/unless the FlashFloppy
        firmware fork for emulating two drives with one Gotek comes together.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Gotek drives and FlashFloppy firmware (you can't use the stock Gotek
        firmware) have been discussed at length elsewhere on the web, so I will
        probably talk about what I had to do for my Epson but won't give general
        advice on how to get FlashFloppy onto a Gotek just now.
      </p>
      <h4>Where to put the drive emulators?</h4>
      <p>
        You want to just replace the original drives? Well, depending on your
        exact model, that might not be too easy. A lot of machines, both
        from Epson and from NEC itself, have floppy disk shaped slots moulded
        into the outer casing for a pre-set number of drives, and won't even
        accept other <i>real</i> floppy drives, if they have the eject button
        in a slightly different position. I consider this to be kind of a jerk
        way to do things, but it seems that it was quite common for companies
        to do this to make their drives integrate more smoothly/aesthetically
        into the casing.
      </p>
      <p>
        If your PC doesn't have nice open rectangular holes in the case, then
        even if you don't want to modify your casing, all hope might not be
        lost. Note that I have not done this yet - but many if not all PC-98's
        have an external floppy drive connector on the back of the system. It
        uses a variant of the so-called "centronics" connector. I believe it
        should be possible to modify your system to identify external drives as
        the first and second drive and to prefer those over the internal ones.
      </p>
      <p>
        Again, I haven't done this, but if the floppy drive 0 and 1 selection
        pins are exposed on the "centronics" connector, then you could simply
        disconnect the internal ones or flip some BIOS setting/DIP switch and
        be good to go. If those lines aren't exposed externally, you can simply
        hijack those lines from the internal floppy drives' ribbon cable and
        pass them out with a method of your choosing.
      </p>
      <p>
        I might elaborate on this if I need to, but for now I will assume you
        can figure out a floppy drive solution that works for you, and
        I will explain how I did mine (internally).
      </p>
      <h4 id="pc9801_buying_wyatt_adding_goteks">Adding Goteks internally on the Epson PC-486GR</h4>
      <p>
        I decided I was going to forego floppies. I just can't trust them
        anymore and I know I'm going to run out of good ones some day.
        Additionally, the 486GR seems to use double-density drives(?) so it's a
        little harder to get good working diskettes for it. It could be that
        I just had the DIP switches configured wrong at the time and the
        floppy drives actually are just fine, though. When I first got it,
        it wouldn't boot anything and it was the DIP switches' fault.
        I haven't tried the real drives since fixing that. I think the
        last owner had them set up for external floppy drive booting.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Epson PC-486GR has two or three floppy drives internally, depending
        on your configuration from the factory. These drives are a little...
        quirky. But they do work and can be adapted to use Goteks instead.
      </p>
      <p>
        For starters, the Epson's 3.5" bays have brackets to fit them in a
        5.25" wide slot in the case, but <b>these slots are not as tall as a
        standard 5.25" bay slot</b>, so you can't just use a normal PC
        mounting bracket for attaching a floppy drive. I was unfortunate
        enough to have pre-emptively ordered two adapter brackets that I now
        cannot use. Anyone want them?&hellip;
      </p>
      <p>
        The <b>good</b> news is that the brackets that come in the Epson are
        able to mount a standard 3.5" floppy drive or Gotek just fine - with
        the caveat that you won't have a nice plastic bezel to cover up the
        gaps on the sides of the Gotek. That's why I have masking tape on the
        front of mine. When I'm not looking directly at it, it's fine! And it
        blocks a little of the noise from the blower fan on the 50MHz 486DX
        that mine has been upgraded with by the previous owner inside.
      </p>
      <p>
        An additional oddity is that the Epson uses laptop-style 26 pin floppy
        disk drives that connect via flat flex cable, attached to an adapter
        board that converts them to use full-sized 5.25" drive card edge
        connectors and large 4-pin "molex" power connectors.

          The transistor and resistor on the adapter board appear to act
          as a NOT gate to invert the 'density' signal, which is inverted
          on the drive itself for some reason.

        Since I don't want or need that adapter board anymore, I need to find
        another way to deliver power to the Gotek and to make the ribbon cable
        actually reach the drives' connectors, since the Goteks don't reach the
        backs of the drive brackets. This means "Molex" to "Berg" power
        adapters, as well as IDC to card edge floppy adapters, <i>plus</i> some
        homemade extension boards to bridge the remaining distance from the IDC
        connector to where the ribbon cable connects at the rears of the
        brackets.

        Someone might be quick to criticize my soldering work. I honestly think
        it's fine. And it took less time than waiting for a custom board to get
        printed somewhere, or for me to learn to etch my own boards.

        Do note, however, that in the final installation there is more
        clearance between the metal shielding and the extension board than
        there may appear to be in this photo. Additionally, the insulated wires
        jumping over the board keep the board act as a "bumper" that prevents
        the perfboard from contacting the metal above it.
      </p>
      <p>
        It's been bulletproof since installation, honestly. I probably wouldn't
        make the extension boards exactly like that again, but I don't regret
        doing it this way this time.

        I have noticed that whenever the drives are not active, the drive
        select lines seem to cycle with a square wave, which causes the LED's
        to flicker fast enough to appear constantly dimly on. I have not
        figured out why that is, nor how the original drives sidestepped the
        problem - although I assume that saturating a capacitor was involved.
        The drive lights come on to full brightness normally when the system
        actually tries to read something or write something.
