      <h2>Lost in Translation:<br/>
        The Hidden World of Old Japanese Domestic Computers
      </h2>
      <p><i>10 Jan 2023</i> [<a class="permalink" href="./011_012.html#pc9801-1">Permanent link</a>]<br/>
        A good friend of mine with a passion for pixel art has long had a
        fascination with old Japanese domestic computers, especially the NEC
        PC-9801 series.
      </p>
      <p>
        I've always been more of a Sharp X68000 man, myself. Not because
        there's anything <i>wrong</i> with the 98, though!&ndash; the X68000 is
        just a much more powerful computer if you are interested in playing
        games, with much stronger graphical capabilities in most respects than
        its competition.
      </p>
      <p>
        Unfortunately, the X68000 has a few problems if you're looking to
        obtain one in 2023:
      </p>
      <p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            It was only ever sold in Japan (obviously).
          </li>
          <li>
            It needs a 24KHz horizontal scan rate monitor, which almost
            nothing in the US does (even VGA flat screens).</li>
          <li>
            A lot of them have bad surface mount capacitors that leak
            out and destroy their circuitry. This is especially apparent with
            the later, more-powerful ones. Pretty much the same problem all
            Sega Game Gears seem to have.</li>
          <li>
            Almost all documentation is in Japanese&hellip; I am trying to learn
            Japanese, but it's like being thrown in the ocean to learn to swim.
          </li>
          <li>
            A lot of the documentation isn't scanned. I'm guessing this is
            some sort of fear about copyright law and the way it is enforced
            in Japan?
          </li>
          <li>
            It was always the underdog computer in the market, and never sold
            as well as its competitors. It also has a fiercely loyal fan-base
            today. Prices are sky-high (perhaps in part because no one is
            satisfied with just one X68000 and they need to have <i>at least
            one</i> of every model).
          </li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p>
        &hellip;Hey, wait a moment. Haven't I seen this somewhere before?
      </p>
      <div class="imgcontain imgwrap" id="a4000_prices">
        <a href="pc9801_1/full/a4000_prices.png">
          <img src="pc9801_1/a4000_prices.png"
               alt="Amiga 4000 prices on ebay, $3000 plus."/>
        </a>
        <div class="imgwrap caption imgcentercaption">
          The X68000 seems to be pretty much analogous to what the Amiga became here.
        </div>
      </div>
      <p>
        So basically, much like with Amigas, the continual interest in the
        platform from people with more money than I have has ensured that I've
        written off being able to afford and justify getting an X68000 in the
        near future, barring incredible luck. But I'm still interested in
        Japanese computers; there are a lot of weird designs out there that are
        intriguing to me, and some of them look absolutely <i>gorgeous</i>.
      </p>

        <div class="imgwrap caption imgcentercaption">
          The Sharp X1. I wish any of my computers looked this good!
        </div>
      </div>
      <p>
        I briefly had considered an X1, which looks stunning, and would also be
        able to run CP/M. But unfortunately (again), there's not much I think I
        would actually <i>do</i> on one, no matter how beautiful it would look
        on my desk. Maybe if I can find a good thing to do on it some day, I'll
        return to thinking about it. The monitor would be pricey, I bet, but
        the X1 computer itself regularly shows up for pretty fair prices
        online, even in red (the objective best color for it).
      </p>
      <h4>Some Reasons NOT to Buy a Japanese Computer</h4>
      <p>
        So, basically, I'd been considering getting into Japanese computers for
        some time, but never following through. Even ignoring the initial cost
        at auction, the shipping fees would be murder on top of that&hellip; and
        there are all sorts of other considerations that I'd have to make when
        buying one, as well, to actually be able to use it here. For instance,
        what kinds of floppies will they use? Do I want to use real floppies,
        or Gotek-style floppy drive hardware emulators and disk images? How
        will i connect a hard drive? How do I actually <i>power</i> the thing?
        What kind of software can I practically use on it? What kind of screen
        do I need?
      </p>
      <p>
        As you might be able to see, it quickly becomes a logistical nightmare
        and a money pit. I'd experienced some of this with my Amiga 500, but
        was lucky enough to get mine with a correct monitor and hard drive and
        power supplies included in the sale at a really nice price, locally,
        with no shipping fees. But I'd still felt the need to upgrade to a newer
        hard drive and caused endless SCSI headaches in the process. I'd
        upgraded the RAM, added a Genlock to subtitle laserdiscs, put in an ECS
        (enhanced) version of its "Denise" chip to enable higher resolutions,
        added a Kickstart (bootloader ROM) switcher to let me boot newer
        versions of Amiga Workbench (the OS), and all sorts of other things to
        better use it. All of that stuff adds up fast! And to do the same on
        a Japanese computer, many of those purchases would include paying
        shipping fees from about halfway across the planet whenever I ran into
        a new problem that needed a hardware solution.
      </p>
      <h4>Why I Still Ended Up Getting a Japanese Computer Anyway</h4>
      <p>
        So, knowing all of this would happen, and that it'd be a massive money
        pit, why did I decide to follow through, eventually?
      </p>
      <p>
        Well, basically, it was because of my aforementioned good friend with
        the pixel art passion.
      </p>
      <p>
        This friend had long been enamored specifically with the NEC PC-9801
        and its descendants. To be completely honest, the PC-98 has some games
        with good artwork and stuff, but it was the least interesting of the
        major Japanese platforms to me. It was the one that sold the best, and
        it wasn't <i>particularly</i> speedy or performant. It also used x86
        CPU's, which means it was the most "IBM-Like" of the big platforms,
        alongside Fujitsu's "FM Towns" line. But the FM Towns had more
        interesting graphical capabilities for playing games. The main draw for
        the PC98, for people interested in games, seems to be one of three
        things these days:
        <ol>
          <li>
            Touhou, a "bullet hell" type shooter game series featuring cutesy
            manga/anime style girl characters which started on the PC-98
            platform. I'd say that (at least from what people <i>say</i> online
            and the frequency with which they say it) this one franchise
            accounts for maybe 40% of the gaming interest in the platform,
            both inside and outside of Japan. The Touhou franchise is still
            ongoing, so that's probably a large part of why it has stayed
            popular while everything else is forgotten.
          </li>
          <li>
            Early PC98-era computer games, aimed at a general audience. Later
            in the system's lifetime, most people interested in computer games
            moved to other platforms. This means either to game consoles like
            the Famicom, Super Famicom, Mega Drive, and so on, or to other
            computer platforms like the aforementioned X68000 (which had some
            <i>excellent</i> arcade ports) or the FM Towns. Some games in this
            category of early general audience games for PC-98 include some
            great RPG's you may or may not have heard of, such as:
            <ul>
              <li>Falcom's <i>Ys</i> franchise, which survives to this day</li>
              <li>Glodia's <i>Emerald Dragon</i>, which has a translation on the
                SNES version&hellip; but I like the art on the PC98 version the
                most.</li>
            </ul>
            I'd say that this interest accounts for maybe 5% of the
            outside-of-Japan interest in the system, and I'd guess maybe 15-25%
            of the interest <i>within</i> Japan.
          </li>
          <li>
            Finally, I can't just dance around it forever, so it's best to just
            address it here. Later in the system's lifetime it became a staple
            for erotic games (abbreviated as <i>eroge</i>). It was very well
            suited to this, since even though its actual performance at
            animating things on the screen was rather poor, it could display
            somewhat high resolution static graphics in a fair number of
            colors. So it was ideal for visual novels. I'd guess that
            internationally this is 60% of the interest and in Japan it's about
            35% of the interest.
          </li>
        </ol>
      </p>
      <p>
        Additionally, there may be some more interest if someone wants to run
        Linux or similar on it, since buying a domestic 486 PC is not
        significantly less expensive anymore.
      </p>
      <p>
        To be honest, the <i>eroge</i> element probably is what interests me
        the <i>least</i> of the above about the 98; I am interested most in the
        computer RPG's that we never got here, both as a way to learn some
        Japanese and because I enjoy the art styles. I played a small portion
        of the English translation of the SNES version of 'Emerald Dragon,' and
        it looks like it might be really, really good storywise. I also have
        played an emulated version of 'Ys' and I <i>loved</i> the soundtrack
        (which was composed by Yuzo Koshiro, who later did the music for
        <i>Streets of Rage</i> and is often considered a master of frequency
        modulation synthesis music).
      </p>
      <p>
        But the other reason i was interested now was because of my friend, who
        has less technical background than I do but who has strong interest in
        learning. She has wanted a PC98 for a long time, and asked for my help
        in figuring out what to get and how to set it up. I decided it might be
        fun for me to get one, too, so we could figure stuff out together - and
        those are the mental gymnastics I did to get into a buying mood. It
        also is a somewhat smaller investment than an X68000, and with a LOT
        more supply available for sale.
      </p>
      <p>
        I've had a <i>lot</i> of fun teaching my friend and watching her gain
        more confidence with electronics. It seems to have been something she
        had wanted to get into for some time, but didn't know where to begin.
        Having been there myself, I suppose I took some sympathy&ndash; and my
        desire to share what I've learned with others also kicked in. Not to
        mention my own shelved curiosity about these platforms. It simply felt
        like it might be the right time.
      </p>
      <p>
        We had talked a lot about older computers in the past, and I expressed
        that I was somewhat familiar with the Japanese computer platforms, at
        least in theory. And it seemed like a fun thing that we could do
        together. So far, it actually has been, although there have been a few
        bumps in the road. I'll hopefully get around to explaining what that
        means exactly soon. At any rate, I had to start researching the PC-9801
        series in more depth to prepare for our respective purchases.
      </p>
      <h3 id="">The PC-9801 is NOT an IBM Clone</h3>
      <p>
        If you came here looking for info on the PC98 series, and aren't just
        casually reading my blog, then you should already know this&ndash; but
        the NEC PC-9801 and its descendants are <i>not</i> just fancier IBM
        PC's. They <i>do</i> have some similarities, on account of their
        chipsets, but if you want to run programs written for an IBM that
        does <b>ANY</b> BIOS calls or direct hardware access, you can expect
        that it might not run on a PC98. If it only uses MS-DOS/PC-DOS API's,
        though, then you might be fine.
      </p>
      <p>
        Basically, <b>don't just expect that you can install your American copy
        of MS-DOS on a PC98 and have it work. It will <i>not</i> work. You will
        have to be able to figure out how to read Japanese; this is unavoidable.
        </b>
      </p>
      <p>
        Here are some of the differences that I have encountered so far, in
        list form:
        <ul>
          <li>Incompatible keyboard protocol and connector - No equivalents outside of Japan
            <ul>
              <li>
                You will need an NEC keyboard or one made by Epson.
              </li>
              <li>
                I will specify more about the Epson option later on.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            Incompatible with PS/2 mouse protocol and connector; uses one of
            the following:
            <ul>
              <li>
                Microsoft "InPort" 9 pin mini-DIN bus mouse (later models)
              </li>
              <li>
                An electrically identical mouse with a 9-pin D-sub (earlier
                models)
              </li>
              <li>
                Passive adapters can be used to convert an inPort mouse to a
                D-Sub connector or vice versa.
              </li>
              <li>
                Quadrature mouses from other computers (Amiga, AT&amp;T 6300,
                and Atari ST, for instance) can be used, but must first be
                re-wired. A pre-ADB Macintosh mouse could be adapted, except
                that you'd be not have a right click button&ndash; which you will
                probably need.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            Incompatible RGB Video Output, both physically and electronically:
            <ul>
              <li>
                Runs at 640x400. 56Hz vertical refresh rate, 24KHz horizontal.
              </li>
              <li>
                Most american market CRT's and even LCD's won't display a
                stable picture with that video mode. Some CRT's may even be
                damaged by attempting to display it.
              </li>
              <li>
                Uses a DA15 connector for analogue RGB out (but does not use
                the same pinout as the old Macs).
              </li>
              <li>
                Some appear to also offer digital RGB out, but I assume this is
                at the same refresh rates as the analogue output. I doubt that
                EGA monitors (350 lines max, ~21KHz) would sync up properly.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>No ISA bus (uses "C-Bus")</li>
          <li>Completely different BIOS interface/boot process</li>
          <li>Different partition table on hard drives</li>
          <li>
            Floppy drive interface is different
            <ul>
              <li>
                Does not use the cable "twist" like IBM compatibles do
              </li>
              <li>
                <i>Almost</i> a standard Shugart interface (adds/moves density pin, READY pin)
              </li>
              <li>
                Drives must be jumpered to set a "drive ID" (due to lack of cable twist)
              </li>
              <li>
                Up to <b>four</b> floppy drives may be connected at once (instead of two)
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            The floppy drives themselves are a little different
            <ul>
              <li>
                Some later ones (about 1993 onward?) support high-density floppies, versus 1987 for IBM PC's
              </li>
              <li>
                Spins 3.5" disks at 360RPM instead of 300RPM to match sector layout and capacity of 5.25" disks.
              </li>
            </ul>

        So, ya really want to learn about the PC-9801, do ya? Well, first, what
        do you want to do with yours? - depending on your answers to the below
        questions, some models may be preferable over others.
      </p>
      <h4>DOS, Windows, or Other?</h4>
      <p>
        If you intend to get a PC98 and run Windows programs on it, you can
        basically treat it as an IBM-compatible PC running that version of
        windows, except with a Japanese locale. I see little reason to do this,
        unless you really want a 486 running Windows but don't like the prices
        on IBM-compatible 486'es.
      </p>
      <p>
        It has also been said by many that the '98 series lost its "98-ness" in
        the mid 90's with the rise of Windows, as the computers moved away from
        the old µPD7220-derived design to using third-party GPU's that were
        more adept at accelerating 2D window management operations. These
        graphics chips were things made by companies like S3, and stripped away
        another bit of uniqueness from the series. Later models also introduced
        features like PCI card slots. The PC98 series rapidly moved towards
        being just a "Windows PC," compatible with win16/win32 programs made
        for IBM-compatible Wintel machines. DOS compatibility still existed to
        an extent, but the further away NEC moved, the more stuff began to
        break in DOS-land, where direct hardware access was still king.
      </p>
      <p>
        Thus, it seems that the PC-98 might have been one of the last
        non-IBM-compatible, non-Apple consumer personal computer series to
        survive in any form. But if you want to run Windows, why not just run
        Windows on an IBM-compatible...?
      </p>
      <p>
        In my personal opinion, the real reasons one should want a PC-9801 are
        some combination of game software, potentially learning Japanese, and
        maybe running free operating systems like the BSD's or Linux distros.
        There is very little attractive about the machines for plain old
        Windows use. In my case I keep a Gateway E-3200 (Pentium 3) around for
        my old Windows software use. It runs US English Windows 98 and Japanese
        Windows 2000, and packs a Voodoo3 GPU; this puts me in a good spot for
        anything I might really want to play in the Windows world, since I'm
        not really too interested in modern Windows games.
      </p>
      <h4>You Have Selected: DOS</h4>
      <p>
        I will just assume you can take a hint and realized that above I was
        essentially saying that DOS is the only real choice here for games, if
        you don't want your computer to be "just another old Windows PC."
      </p>
      <p>
        The rest of this article will probably not focus on Windows much, if at
        all.
      </p>
      <h3 id="pc9801_what_are_my_options">What are My Options for Hardware, then?</h3>
      <p>
        I stumbled my way into my choice based on a combination of factors.
        First of all, as mentioned above, I wanted it to be viable for DOS
        games. I also wanted it to be new enough to be able to run the same
        things my friend was running, which are largely from the era where the
        games don't look quite "8-bit" anymore and the pixel art can be more
        intricate. I also wanted it to be capable of FM sound (Yamaha YM2203 or
        YM2608). These chips have a lot in common with the YM2612 chip used in
        the Sega Mega Drive/Genesis consoles. I also desired expandability,
        the ability to use a hard drive, and to be honest I sort of wanted
        to do something no one else was doing.
      </p>
      <p>
        So, if you want a PC-98
      </p>
      <p>
        Of course, I ignored all of the above options. NEC? That's just too
        mainstream.
