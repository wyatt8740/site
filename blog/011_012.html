      <p><i>1 Nov 2023</i> [<a class="permalink" href="./011_012.html#pc9801-1">Permanent link</a>]<br/>
        A good friend of mine with a passion for pixel art has long had a
        fascination with old Japanese domestic computers, especially the NEC
        PC-9801 series. This started me on another deep dive into things I
        didn't understand, but which I now want to document and help others
        to discover.
      </p>
      <!-- pc9801_buying_wyatt_introduction -->
      <p>
        I also think that my friend will probably end up collaborating with me
        on this, so if that's the case then this may be a <i>joint</i> post.
        I'll let her decide how much she feels like sharing, though. I think
        we will be trying to compartmentalize into sections so it's somewhat
        clear who's who. But this article is still under construction, so be
        warned!
      </p>
      <p>
        So far, this article is on track to be longer than even the Bubblegum
        Crisis posts I made before. So again, be warned.
      </p>
      <p>
        I anticipate that this page is going to get rather long, so I'm providing
        a Table of Contents for the core of this post (everything after the
        introduction).

      <p>
        I've always been more of a Sharp X68000 person, myself. Not because
        there's anything <i>wrong</i> with the 98, though!&ndash; the X68000 is
        just a much more powerful computer if you are interested in playing
        games, with much stronger graphical capabilities in most respects than
        its competition.
      </p>
      <p>
        Unfortunately, the X68000 has a few problems if you're looking to
        obtain one in 2023:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          It was only ever sold in Japan (obviously).
        </li>
        <li>
          It needs a 24KHz horizontal scan rate monitor, which almost
          nothing in the US does (even VGA flat screens).</li>
        <li>
          A lot of them have bad surface mount capacitors that leak
          out and destroy their circuitry. This is especially apparent with
          the later, more-powerful ones. Pretty much the same problem all
          Sega Game Gears seem to have.</li>
        <li>
          Almost all documentation is in Japanese&hellip; I am trying to learn
          Japanese, but it's like being thrown in the ocean to learn to swim.
        </li>
        <li>
          A lot of the documentation isn't scanned. I'm guessing this is
          some sort of fear about copyright law and the way it is enforced
          in Japan?
        </li>
        <li>
          It was always the underdog computer in the market, and never sold
          as well as its competitors. It also has a fiercely loyal fan-base
          today. Prices are sky-high (perhaps in part because no one is
          satisfied with just one X68000 and they need to have <i>at least
          one</i> of every model).
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        &hellip;Hey, wait a moment. Haven't I seen this somewhere before?
      </p>
      <div class="imgcontain imgwrap" id="a4000_prices">
        <a href="pc9801_1/full/a4000_prices.png">
          <img src="pc9801_1/a4000_prices.png"
               alt="Amiga 4000 prices on ebay, $3000 plus."/>
        </a>
        <div class="imgwrap caption imgcentercaption">
          The X68000 seems to be pretty much analogous to what the Amiga became here.<br/>
          I'd rather buy a decent used car, personally.
        </div>
      </div>
      <p>
        So basically, much like with Amigas, the continual interest in the
        platform from people with more money than I have has ensured that I've
        written off being able to afford and justify getting an X68000 in the
        near future, barring incredible luck. But I'm still interested in
        Japanese computers; there are a lot of weird designs out there that are
        intriguing to me, and some of them look absolutely <i>gorgeous</i>.
      </p>
      <div class="imgcontain imgwrap" id="sharp_x1">
        <a href="pc9801_1/full/sharp_x1.jpg">

        </a>
        <div class="imgwrap caption imgcentercaption">
          The Sharp X1. I wish any of my computers looked this good!
        </div>
      </div>
      <p>
        I briefly had considered an X1, which looks stunning, and would also be
        able to run CP/M. But unfortunately (again), there's not much I think I
        would actually <i>do</i> on one, no matter how beautiful it would look
        on my desk. Maybe if I can find a good thing to do on it some day, I'll
        return to thinking about it. The monitor would be pricey, I bet, but
        the X1 computer itself regularly shows up for pretty fair prices
        online, even in red (the objective best color for it).
      </p>
      <h3>Some Reasons NOT to Buy a Japanese Computer</h3>
      <p>
        So, basically, I'd been considering getting into Japanese computers for
        some time, but never following through. Even ignoring the initial cost
        at auction, the shipping fees would be murder on top of that&hellip; and
        there are all sorts of other considerations that I'd have to make when
        buying one, as well, to actually be able to use it here. For instance,
        what kinds of floppies will they use? Do I want to use real floppies,
        or Gotek-style floppy drive hardware emulators and disk images? How
        will i connect a hard drive? How do I actually <i>power</i> the thing?
        What kind of software can I practically use on it? What kind of screen
        do I need?
      </p>
      <p>
        As you might be able to see, it quickly becomes a logistical nightmare
        and a money pit. I'd experienced some of this with my Amiga 500, but
        was lucky enough to get mine with a correct monitor and hard drive and
        power supplies included in the sale at a really nice price, locally,
        with no shipping fees. But I'd still felt the need to upgrade to a newer
        hard drive and caused endless SCSI headaches in the process. I'd
        upgraded the RAM, added a Genlock to subtitle laserdiscs, put in an ECS
        (enhanced) version of its "Denise" chip to enable higher resolutions,
        added a Kickstart (bootloader ROM) switcher to let me boot newer
        versions of Amiga Workbench (the OS), and all sorts of other things to
        better use it. All of that stuff adds up fast! And to do the same on
        a Japanese computer, many of those purchases would include paying
        shipping fees from about halfway across the planet whenever I ran into
        a new problem that needed a hardware solution.
      </p>
      <h3>Why I Still Ended Up Getting a Japanese Computer Anyway</h3>
      <p>
        So, knowing all of this would happen, and that it'd be a massive money
        pit, why did I decide to follow through, eventually?
      </p>
      <p>
        Well, basically, it was because of my aforementioned good friend with
        the pixel art passion.
      </p>
      <h2>The NEC PC-9801</h2>
      <h3>Why Do People Get the PC-9801?</h3>
      <p>
        My aforementioned good friend had long been enamored specifically with
        the NEC PC-9801 and its descendants. To be completely honest, the PC-98
        has some games with good artwork and stuff, but it was the <i>least</i>
        interesting of the major Japanese platforms to me. It was the one that
        sold the best, and it wasn't <i>particularly</i> speedy or performant.
        It also used x86 CPU's, which means it was the most "IBM-Like" of the
        big platforms, alongside Fujitsu's "FM Towns" line. But the FM Towns
        had more interesting graphical capabilities for playing games and
        multimedia. The draw for the PC-98, for people interested in games,
        seems to be one of three things these days.

          Touhou, a "bullet hell" type shooter game series featuring cutesy
          manga/anime style girl characters which started on the PC-98
          platform. I'd say that (at least from what people <i>say</i> online
          and the frequency with which they say it) this one franchise
          accounts for maybe 40% of the gaming interest in the platform,
          both inside and outside of Japan. The Touhou franchise is still
          ongoing, so that's probably a large part of why it has stayed
          popular while everything else is forgotten.
        </li>
        <li>
          Early PC-98 era computer games, aimed at a general audience. Later
          in the system's lifetime, most people interested in computer games
          moved to other platforms. This means either to game consoles like
          the Famicom, Super Famicom, Mega Drive, and so on, or to other
          computer platforms like the aforementioned X68000 (which had some
          <i>excellent</i> arcade ports) or the FM Towns. Some games in this
          category of early general audience games for PC-98 include some
          great RPG's you may or may not have heard of, such as:
          <ul>
            <li>
              Falcom's <i>Ys</i> franchise, which survives to this day.
            </li>
            <li>
              Glodia's <i>Emerald Dragon</i>, which has a translation on the
              SNES version&hellip; but I like the art on the PC-98 version the
              most.
            </li>
          </ul>
          I'd say that this interest accounts for maybe 5% of the
          outside-of-Japan interest in the system, and I'd guess maybe 15-25%
          of the interest <i>within</i> Japan.
        </li>
        <li>
          Finally, I can't just dance around it forever, so it's best to just
          address it here. Later in the system's lifetime it became a staple
          for visual novels and erotic games (abbreviated as <i>eroge</i>).
          It was very well suited to this, since even though its actual
          performance at animating things on the screen was rather poor, it
          could display somewhat high resolution static graphics in a fair
          number of colors. So it was ideal for visual novels. I'd guess that
          internationally this is 60% of the interest and in Japan it's about
          35% of the interest.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        Additionally, there may be some more interest if someone wants to run
        Linux or similar on it, since buying a domestic 486 PC is not
        significantly less expensive anymore.
      </p>
      <p>
        To be honest, the visual novel and eroge element probably is what
        interests me the <i>least</i> of the above about the 98; I am
        interested most in the computer RPG's that we never got here, both as a
        way to learn some Japanese and because I enjoy the art styles, music,
        and stories. I played a small portion of the English translation of the
        SNES version of 'Emerald Dragon,' and it looks like it might be really,
        really good storywise. I also have played an emulated version of 'Ys'
        and I <i>loved</i> the soundtrack (which was composed by Yuzo Koshiro,
        who later did the music for <i>Streets of Rage</i> and is often
        considered a master of frequency modulation synthesis music).
      </p>
      <p>
        Sure, there are a handful of visual novel-esque games that I would
        really like to play, though. Hideo Kojima's acclaimed <i>Snatcher</i>
        comes to mind, for instance. But that had a Sega CD port (in English,
        I might add), so why not just play that?!
      </p>
      <h3>Why Did <i>I</i> Get the PC-9801?</h3>
      <h4>(The Influence of Friendship On Financial Decisions)</h4>
      <p>
        In the end, the primary reason i was interested now was because of my
        friend, who has less technical background than I do but who has strong
        interest in learning - not just about the PC-98, but about computing
        and old electronics in general. She has wanted a PC-98 for a long time,
        and asked for my help in figuring out what to get and how to set it up.
      </p>
      <p>
        I decided that it might be fun for me to get one, too, so we could
        figure stuff out together. And such were the mental gymnastics I did to
        get into a buying mood. It also is a somewhat smaller investment than
        an X68000, and with a LOT more supply available for sale in both
        computers and the parts for them, with less intense demand.
      </p>
      <p>
        I have already had a <i>lot</i> of fun teaching my friend and watching
        her gain more confidence with electronics. It seems to have been
        something she had wanted to get into for some time, but didn't know
        where to begin. Having been there myself, I suppose I took some
        sympathy. My desire to share what I've learned with others
        also kicked in, since sharing what I've learned is what I live for.
        Coupled with my own shelved (out of practicality) curiosity about these
        platforms. It simply felt like it might finally be the right time.
      </p>
      <p>
        We had talked a lot about older computers in the past, and I expressed
        that I was somewhat familiar with the Japanese computer platforms, at
        least in theory. And it seemed like a fun thing that we could do
        together. So far, it actually has been, although there have been a few
        bumps in the road. I'll hopefully get around to explaining what exactly
        those bumps are soon. At any rate, I had to start researching the
        PC-9801 series in earnest to prepare us for our respective purchases.

      <h2 id="pc9801_buying_wyatt_guide_top">Wyatt's PC-9801 Buyer and User Guide</h2>
      <p>
        First off, let's address something very basic but of <b><i>absolutely
        critical</i></b> importance for understanding fully what you are about
        to get yourself into, and how deep you can expect to get into it.
      </p>
      <h3 id="pc9801_buying_wyatt_not_an_ibm_clone">The PC-9801 is NOT an IBM Clone! </h3>
      <p>
        If you came here looking for info on the PC-98 series, and aren't just
        casually reading my blog, then you should already know this&ndash; but
        the NEC PC-9801 and its descendants are <i>not</i> just fancier IBM
        PC's. They <i>do</i> have some similarities, on account of their
        chipsets, but if you want to run programs written for an IBM that
        does <b>ANY</b> BIOS calls or direct hardware access, you can expect
        that it might not run on a PC-98. If it only uses MS-DOS/PC-DOS API's,
        though, then you might be fine.
      </p>
      <p>
        For starters,, <b>don't just expect that you can install your American
        copy of MS-DOS on a PC-98 and have it work. It will <i>not</i> work. You
        will also have to be able to figure out how to use DOS in Japanese;
        this is most probably totally unavoidable.</b> Things that have been
        unofficially translated for the PC-98 is <b>quite scarce</b> compared
        to all of the impressive accomplishments that have been made by ROM
        hackers and fan translators for game consoles and newer Windows games.
      </p>
      <p>
        Here are some of the hardware and software architectural differences
        between the PC-9801 and IBM-compatibles (known as DOS/V systems in
        Japan) that I have encountered so far, in list form.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Incompatible keyboard protocol and connector</b>:
          <ul>
            <li>No equivalents outside of Japan, except <b>perhaps</b> for
              the NEC APC I, II, and III keyboards (unverified). These are
              <b>pretty hard to find</b> now, and <b>don't have as many keys
                as a PC-9801 keyboard</b>, so some keys may not be usable.
              Plus, anyone who actually has an APC III probably needs one of
              those keyboards more than you do, with how prone to cannibalism
              mechanical keyboard hoarders are and how many systems go up for
              sale on ebay keyboard-less.
            </li>
            <li>
              You will need an NEC PC-9801/9821 keyboard (8801 doesn't work),
              or one made by Epson. I will say more about the Epson board
              option later on.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Incompatible with PS/2 mouse protocol and connector;</b> uses one of
          the following:
          <ul>
            <li>
              Microsoft "InPort" 9 pin mini-DIN bus mouse (later models)
            </li>
            <li>
              An electrically identical mouse with a 9-pin D-sub (earlier
              models)
            </li>
            <li>
              Passive adapters can be used to convert an inPort mouse to a
              D-Sub connector or vice versa. <b>These are NOT the same as
                PS/2 to serial adapters!</b>
            </li>
            <li>
              Quadrature mouses from other computers (Amiga, AT&amp;T 6300,
              and Atari ST, for instance) <b>CAN</b> be used, but must first
              be re-wired. A pre-ADB Macintosh mouse could be adapted, except
              that you'd be not have a right click button&hellip; which you
              will probably need.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Incompatible RGB Video Output, both physically and electronically</b>:
          <ul>
            <li>
              Runs at 640x400. 56.4 Hz vertical refresh rate, 24.81 KHz
              horizontal.
            </li>
            <li>
              Most american market CRT's and even LCD's won't display a
              stable picture with that video mode. Some CRT's may even be
              damaged by attempting to display it. Unless one you are
              thinking of buying <i>specifically</i> claims to cover both
              these horizontal and vertical scan rates, you should assume it
              will not.
            </li>
            <li>
              Uses a DA15 connector for analogue RGB out (but does not use
              the same pinout as the old Macs).
            </li>
            <li>
              Some appear to also offer digital RGB out, but I assume this is
              at the same refresh rates as the analogue output. I doubt that
              EGA monitors (350 lines max, ~21KHz) would sync up properly.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>No ISA bus (uses "C-Bus")</li>
        <li>Completely different BIOS interface/boot process</li>
        <li>Different partition table on hard drives</li>
        <li>
          Floppy drive interface is different
          <ul>
            <li>
              Does not use the cable "twist" like IBM compatibles do
            </li>
            <li>
              <i>Almost</i> a standard Shugart interface (adds/moves density pin, READY pin)
            </li>
            <li>
              Drives must be jumpered to set a "drive ID" (due to lack of cable twist)
            </li>
            <li>
              Up to <b>four</b> floppy drives may be connected at once (instead of two)
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          The floppy drives themselves are a little different
          <ul>
            <li>
              Some later ones (about 1993 onward?) support high-density floppies, versus 1987 for IBM PC's
            </li>
            <li>
              Spins 3.5" disks at 360RPM instead of 300RPM to match sector layout and capacity of 5.25" disks.
            </li>
          </ul>

          CGA, EGA, Tandy, or VGA chipset. Potentially more than one of them.

      <h3 id="pc9801_which_pc">Choose Your Kart (Computer)!</h3>
      <p>
        So, ya really want to learn about the PC-9801, do ya? Well, first, what
        do you want to do with yours? - depending on your answers to the below
        questions, some models may be preferable over others.
      </p>
      <p>
        Since there was never a "PC-98 building industry" to my knowledge,
        given the proprietary nature of the platform, you will have to settle
        for an OEM-made machine. This makes choosing the correct one for your
        needs even more important, since it's much less likely you can just
        pop something out of a socket and upgrade it later (on many models).
        Many have soldered-down CPU's, for instance, which obviously precludes
        most people from being able to upgrade them.
      </p>
      <p>
        The PSU's are similarly designed for the power budget of the machine as
        it came configured, with some overhead for cards. The connectors are
        not necessarily going to be standardized, and I doubt that most will
        accept an AT or ATX PSU. So if you want to upgrade your PSU, you may
        end up having to hunt for a related model that came from the factory
        with a beefier PSU to steal parts from - or perhaps you will be able
        to do a custom wiring job, if you're confident with that, and make
        some other PSU work.
      </p>
      <p>
        Finally, even if something looks like a standard connector, don't take
        that for granted. Do your research first! Don't just assume the best
        of all possible worlds, where everything works with everything, because
        I think it's safe to say we aren't in Kansas anymore.

               alt="(Bubblegum Crisis PC-98 game screenshot, looking up at

          <a href="./007_008.html#bubblegum-review-1">Bubblegum Crisis</a>
          game on the PC-9801!)
        </div>
      </div>
      <p>
        Regarding the above picture, Bubblegum Crisis is actually an example of
        a game where the system you choose matters. The game uses FM sound, so
        it needs to be new enough for that, and it also makes no attempt to
        throttle itself to match the framerate of the screen - it just runs at
        full-tilt all the time, so you have to be able to make the computer run
        slow enough for it to be playable. It's comically fast at 75 MHz.
      </p>
      <h4>DOS, Windows, or Other?</h4>
      <p>
        If you intend to get a PC-98 and run Windows programs on it, you can
        basically treat it as an IBM-compatible PC running that version of
        Windows, except with a Japanese locale. I see little reason to do this,
        unless you really want a 486 running Windows but don't like the prices
        on IBM-compatible 486'es.
      </p>
      <p>
        It has also been said by many that the 98 series lost its "98-ness" in
        the mid 90's with the rise of Windows, as the computers moved away from
        the old µPD7220-derived design to using third-party GPU's that were
        more adept at accelerating 2D window management operations. These
        graphics chips were things made by companies like S3, and stripped away
        another bit of uniqueness from the series. Later models also introduced
        features like PCI card slots. The PC-98 series rapidly moved towards
        being just a "Windows PC," compatible with win16/win32 programs made
        for IBM-compatible Wintel machines. DOS compatibility still existed to
        an extent, but the further away NEC moved, the more stuff began to
        break in DOS-land, where direct hardware access was still king.
      </p>
      <p>
        Thus, it seems that the PC-98 might have been one of the last
        non-IBM-compatible, non-Apple consumer personal computer series to
        survive in any form. But if you want to run Windows, why not just run
        Windows on an IBM-compatible...?
      </p>
      <p>
        In my personal opinion, the real reasons one should want a PC-9801 are
        some combination of game software, potentially learning Japanese, and
        maybe running free operating systems like the BSD's or Linux distros.
        There is very little attractive about the machines for plain old
        Windows use. In my case I keep a Gateway E-3200 (Pentium 3) around for
        my old Windows software use. It runs US English Windows 98 and Japanese
        Windows 2000, and packs a Voodoo3 GPU; this puts me in a good spot for
        anything I might really want to play in the Windows world, since I'm
        not really too interested in modern Windows games.
      </p>
      <h4>You Have Selected: DOS</h4>
      <p>
        I will just assume you can take a hint and realized that above I was
        essentially saying that DOS is the only real choice here for games, if
        you don't want your computer to be "just another old Windows PC."
      </p>
      <p>
        The rest of this article will probably not focus on Windows much, if at
        all.
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <h3 id="pc9801_buying_wyatt_what_are_my_options">What are My Options for Hardware, then?</h3>
      <p>
        I stumbled my way into my choice based on a combination of factors.
        First of all, as mentioned above, I wanted it to be viable for DOS
        games. I also wanted it to be new enough to be able to run the same
        things my friend was running, which are largely from the era where the
        games don't look quite "8-bit" anymore and the pixel art can be more
        intricate. I also wanted it to be capable of FM sound (Yamaha YM2203 or
        YM2608). These chips have a lot in common with the YM2612 chip used in
        the Sega Mega Drive/Genesis consoles. I also desired expandability,
        the ability to use a hard drive, and to be honest I sort of wanted
        to do something no one else was doing.
      </p>
      <p>
        So, if you want a PC-98 for DOS, and you don't want to buy one for
        early games and another for late games, I'd say a 486 or 386 is the
        ideal range to choose from. Circa perhaps 1990 to 1994. You can find a
        list of a whole bunch of machines
        <a href="https://pc-9800.net/">on this site</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        First, I helped my friend to choose something. She already kind of
        knew what she wanted, so all I really had to do was cross reference
        the models she talked about with the ones on that site to check for
        red flags.
      </p>
      <h4>PC-9801 or PC-9821?</h4>
      <p>
        The PC-9801 was the original series of computers. The best way to
        describe the differences might just be to show how the PC-9801 and
        PC-9821 lines tended to differ.
      </p>
      <p>
        This distinction is for the most part illusory. There are certain
        things correlated with one series or the other, and the original
        target markets for the two lines were different, but being badged
        a "PC-9821" originally was supposed to signify that it was
        "Windows-ready" and better for multimedia, as far as I can tell.
        Some PC-9821's were still sold with just MS-DOS installed and
        without hard drives, so 9821 does not necessarily mean "Windows"
        in all cases.
      </p>
      <h4>9821:</h4>
      <p>
        The PC-9821 models came out targetted at use by Windows users, and have
        some quality of life improvements. For instance, to change settings on a
        PC-9801, you flip a bunch of DIP switches and need to have documentation
        to discover what they do (they are not necessarily marked on the board).
        But with the 9821, by holding the 'HELP' key while booting, you can
        enter a software configurator which shows you virtual dip switches that
        you can flip, with inline help text describing what each switch is
        doing. It can be a real time saver.
      </p>
      <p>
        The 9821 line also usually has different floppy disk drives - from what
        I can gather, the 9801 series usually had 5.25" and the 9821 usually
        had 3.5". Since 3.5" floppies are a LOT easier to come by in good
        shape, and just generally age a little better, that may be one reason
        to consider using a PC-9821 if you intend to keep the original floppy
        drives.
      </p>
      <p>
        It should be noted that <i>on the PC-98</i>, it is possible to write
        any PC-98 5.25" floppy disk image to a 3.5" floppy disk and it will
        work (if the computer and drive both can handle the density/coercivity
        of the media). You may have to reformat the disk first if using a
        western market disk, but 'ufiformat' on Linux can do it. This is to
        say, the PC-98 treats 3.5" floppy drives as just miniaturized 5.25"
        drives, with the same numbers of tracks and sectors as a 5.25" disk.
        Later ones (mostly 9821's) can also support 1.44MB formatted
        high density disks, but most software was distributed on 1.2MB disks.
      </p>
      <p>
        A 9821 is also much more likely to come with an IDE hard disk drive,
        or at least with a controller and connector for one. Typically, with
        a 9801, you need to use a SCSI controller and SCSI drives to get large
        storage capabilities. I personally struggle to make SCSI do what I want
        sometimes, and documentation on many PC-98 SCSI controllers seems
        relatively poor, so that might be another argument for using a 9821.
      </p>
      <p>
        As will be seen below, there is one major reason apart from CPU speed
        (and even more important than CPU speed, arguably) not to get most
        9821 models: western graphics accelerator chipsets for Windows which
        are not entirely compatible with DOS games written with the uPD7220
        and its evolutions in mind. Some may work, some may not. Read on.
      </p>
      <h4>9801:</h4>
      <p>
        The 9801's were intended to be DOS machines; it may be easier to find a
        low-powered one, and it will <i>definitely</i> be easier to find one
        without a window accelerator GPU built-in. They seem to be generally
        less desirable than the early 9821's. Also, this is just something I
        have heard, but people say it's harder to open up the earlier 9801's
        (although later ones are probably pretty okay).
      </p>
      <h3>Yeah, But What Does All of That Mean?</h3>
      <p>
        I threw around a lot of terms describing the differences between the
        9801 and 9821. To elaborate a little, here's some more detailed
        explanations of what you should try to look for or avoid.
      </p>
      <h4>Red Flag #1: Leaking Real-Time Clock (RTC) Battery</h4>
      <p>
        The one reason I hesitate at all to suggest buying an untested PC-98 is
        that some of them use Nickel-Cadmium (NiCad) real time clock batteries.
        Every system with one of those should be treated as a time bomb, if
        not already dead. Those NiCad battery barrels seem to be more common
        in older stuff. But they are mounted to the motherboard, so when they
        leak out, they start corroding the copper traces away. If it's not
        caught quickly and treated/cleaned, it can and will kill motherboards.
        If you're not sure which kind of battery a particular model uses,
        proceed with caution.
      </p>

        </a>
        <div class="imgwrap caption imgcentercaption">
          My Commodore Amiga A501 memory expansion board - another victim of
          clock NiCad battery leakage.<br/>
          Oftentimes with old computers, the battery is on the motherboard itself, and it takes the motherboard with it.
        </div>
      </div>
      <p>
        If your system has a barrel battery, I suggest IMMEDIATELY
        clipping/removing it from the board, buying a new battery cell, and
        mounting it in a holder attached to the motherboard via a wire. If there
        was leakage but the board still works, you should polish off the area
        of leakage (down to good copper), use a little alcohol, and then re-seal
        it with nail polish or something similar.
      </p>
      <p>
        It's worth noting that not all RTC batteries are NiCads. I've also seen
        rechargeable coin cell batteries, which seem to be much more reliable.
      </p>
      <p>
        The ones that my friend got ended up not having barrel batteries, but
        I believe the PC-98DO has one and lots of others besides also do.
      </p>
      <h4>Red Flag #2: Integrated window accelerator graphics chip</h4>
      <p>
        Onboard window accelerator cards are for making Windows run with nice
        effects, like showing the contents of windows while dragging them
        around. Unfortunately, these machines force you to use that graphics
        chipset; there's no way to just "unplug" it and go back to using
        the old µPD7220 derivatives. So my friend needed to rule out
        <i>most</i> of the PC-9821 line. <b>But</b>, some of the early ones
        still had either no GPU card built in, or else simply had an
        accelerator card pre-installed that could easily be popped out.
      </p>
      <h4 id="pc9801_buying_wyatt_no_fm_sound">Red Flag #3: No FM sound</h4>
      <p>
        Some later systems omitted the FM sound, especially laptop PC-98
        models. We didn't look at the laptop models in much detail, though,
        since my friend very clearly expressed that she wanted a desktop model.
        Early models lacking FM sound are far too old to be able to play any
        but the oldest PC-98 DOS games at a decent speed.
      </p>
      <p>
        From what I can tell, NEC <b>never made any laptops with FM sound</b>
        that did not have a built-in graphics accelerator of some kind.
        So beware. However, in the section about what I bought below (I did not
        buy a laptop), I will mention a possible workaround.
      </p>
      <p>
        There are two main kinds of FM sound chips to consider; the "26-Sound"
        and "86-Sound." If your system has 26-sound, it's much better than
        nothing, but be forewarned that you might still end up springing for a
        PC-9801-86 sound card board if you want stereo sound, PCM audio
        playback, or Atari-style joystick compatibility. And that card on its
        own seems to cost upwards of $100 USD. So factor that in when ordering.
      </p>
      <p>
        The PC-9801-26K card is a cheaper option, but still over $50 plus
        shipping. And if your machine isn't new enough to have an integrated
        26K, then it may be too weak for most <i>later</i> DOS games
        graphically and processor-wise.
      </p>
      <p>
        Some 9821's (most, if not all, actually) have the "86 Sound" (YM2608)
        built-in. On these systems, you can connect a joystick to the system
        via an adapter that plugs into the keyboard port. I might add a
        diagram for this at some point, but basically you need to ground
        one or two wires and then hook the remaining pins up to the joystick
        inputs. People on yahoo auctions will sell you pre-made adapter cables,
        and I didn't have too much trouble finding instructions for making one.
        I am also feeling kind of lazy at the moment, given how much devotion
        I am putting into just writing this article as it is. The VGA adapter
        diagram elsewhere in this post took over an hour to research, draw, and
        make it look all nice in the page. So did the other mouse adapter one.
      </p>
      <h4>Red Flag #4: No CD Drive</h4>
      <p>
        This isn't an instant "NEVER buy this" or anything, but if you don't
        have a CD drive built in, you may have to add one via a SCSI
        controller card for some games. So be sure to factor in that additional
        cost, if having a CD drive actually matters to you.
      </p>
      <p>
        People have been doing work on adding CD digital audio (CDDA) playback
        to solutions like SCSI2SD (ZuluSCSI), but as of my writing this it
        seems most if not all existing ZuluSCSI boards do not have the
        necessary hardware wired up for audio output, so there is still value
        in a physical CD drive, even beyond it just "feeling right" - but
        if you don't need music via CD playback, then ZuluSCSI boards can
        emulate a data CD drive, which is enough for installing something like
        Windows 98 or some games.
      </p>
      <h4>Red Flag #5: There is no Red Flag #5</h4>
      <p>
        If you avoid a window accelerator built into the motherboard, and your
        system has FM sound built in (especially a YM2608, for "86-Sound"),
        you have already ensured that your system will be at least largely
        compatible with most older DOS things. If you have a CD drive and
        a non-leaked (or coin cell) clock battery, that's even better.
      </p>
      <p>
        I guess I could say "dirty computers are less likely to be good than
        ones that look well cared for," or that "rusty computers are a red
        flag," but it really depends on where the rust is and the extent of the
        rust. There are other things I might be able to say, too, but I can't
        think of them offhandedly and the above are the HUGE ones.
      </p>
      <p>
        I might just add that you shouldn't be dependent on the hard drive
        (if yours is sent with one) still working. Have contingency plans.
      </p>
      <h2 id="pc9801_buying_wyatt_what_my_friend_bought">What My Friend Bought (and Her Experiences)</h2>
      <p>
        My friend chose to get two systems, a PC-9821 Cs2 and a PC-9821 Ce2.
        I believe the idea was that if something was broken, she'd be able to
        swap parts to get at least one system working fully. It ended up being
        a good thing that she did get two, which I also intend to talk about
        in detail later, but for now suffice to say one of the floppy drives
        was unreliable and one of the CD drives didn't work. There was also
        another little incident after arrival that made it doubly good that she
        had both systems. More on that later.
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>(If she sends me some nice pictures, they could appear here soon.)</i>
      </p>
      <h2 id="pc9801_buying_wyatt_what_i_bought">What I Bought (and My Experiences)</h2>
      <p>
        Me? Well, I pretty much just ignored all of the above options. NEC?
        Pssh. That's so <i>mainstream</i>. I can do better than that.
      </p>
      <p>
        Sorry for the misdirection! - There was actually a <i>third</i> option
        (beyond the 9801 and the 9821) which I purposefully neglected to
        mention. The moral is, don't let people like me make you believe that
        only what we're presenting are options! Even if I don't mean badly, I
        could simply be misinformed or underinformed. I highly suggest not
        leaning just on one or two people's buying guides. There's probably
        a lot I'm leaving out, just like others have left things out of theirs.
      </p>
      <p>
        Of course, if you discover errors or oversights, or have more to share,
        I'd love to hear about your experiences. My contact info is on github
        and gitlab (username: wyatt8740) in my commit logs for the projects
        I have hosted there. I'd share my address here, but I'm not too good at
        munging addresses for avoiding spambots.
      </p>
      <p>
        So, without further ado, allow me to introduce you to the third option:
        my Epson PC-486GR (from 1992)!

        It covers a few of the requirements above, but also lacks a fair number
        of them. I think it should be expandable enough to accomodate most
        of it.
      </p>
      <p>
        Seiko Epson made PC-98 compatible clone computers in the 1980's and
        1990's. It seems to be the only company that ever did, strangely
        enough... apparently, other companies considered it but were
        worried about the loss of reputation that would be involved. And
        NEC definitely was hostile to the idea of competition; they locked
        Epsons out from using its versions of DOS and some of its PC-98
        expansion cards in software.

        find a single mention of incompatibility other than in that NEC itself
        added "Epson checks" to some of its cards' boot ROM's and to some
        versions of NEC's MS-DOS variant for the 98 series that would make
        the computers fail to boot (an act of blatant anticompetitive sabotage,

        Anyway, back on topic: Without access to an NEC machine, it's hard to
        know if the few problems I've had are compatibility issues or not, but
        when my friend with the NEC-brand computers has time I'll ask her to
        try running some of my software and we'll see. But I can affirm that
        pretty much everything works; just some of the older software has some
        glitches which to me seems consistent with my expectations. My unit has
        enhanced graphical capabilities compared to early or mid-80's models,
        and I suspect that my problems are simply a result of the upgraded
        hardware and that mine is in fact "bug-compatible" with the 486-class
        NEC computers.

      <p>
        Some of Epson's computers seem to have one additional awesome feature
        which I was not aware of when I bought mine: apparently, you can use
        one
        <a href="https://98epjunk.shakunage.net/fdd/terminal_fdd_mode.html">as
        an external floppy drive bay for another PC.</a> I first discovered
        this about them about a month after getting mine while reading through
        a Japanese message board
        <a href="https://kizuna.5ch.net/test/read.cgi/i4004/1525089405/?v=pc#830">
        thread archive.</a> You can even use one of the supported Epson PC
        models as an external drive for an NEC PC-9801. The one limitation
        appears to be that only 1.2MB HD disks are supported in this mode
        (not single density, DD, or 1.44MB HD disks). Thankfully, just about
        everything I care about apart from ys is on HD media anyway. This
        feature seems to be endemic to Epson's PC-98 compatibles; this mode
        does not exist on any NEC models to my knowledge.

        It appears that soft DIP switches 2-7 and 2-4 might need to be changed,
        but I am having trouble deciphering what their values should be for
        correct operation. If the software configurator lets you flip both,
        then both. Otherwise, I would try just setting switch 2-4 first and
        seeing what happens. I think 2-7 is only needed if your system has
        three internal floppy disk drives. Mine (regrettably) does not have the
        5.25" drive.
      </p>
      <p>
        2-4 is the "FDD terminal mode" switch on my PC-486GR, as seen below.

        The last thing about this terminal mode to note is that you can use

      <h3 id="pc9801_buying_wyatt_epson_laptops">Laptop Features</h3>
      <p>
        You may recall that I said in the
        <a href="#pc9801_buying_wyatt_no_fm_sound">"red flags" section</a>
        that no PC-98 laptops without a window accelerator chip built-in have
        FM sound. this seems to definitely be true, from the documentation I
        have seen, but only because I specified that <i>"<b>NEC</b> never made
        any."</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        Because guess what?
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="https://kizuna.5ch.net/test/read.cgi/i4004/1525089405/?v=pc#912">
          Epson <i>did</i> make (some of) them.
        </a>
      </p>
      <p>
        Due to Epson's "upgradeability" as a marketing feature, it looks like it
        was made possible to swap one screen for another after buying if you wanted
        an upgrade; due to this, giving model numbers is kind of meaningless, but
        if you <a href="https://pc-9800.net/db_epson/note_index.htm">start
        with the 1993 models here</a> you will see the ones that came with color
        screens in "stock" configuration.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, you should be warned that many if not practically all of them
        no longer have functioning screens, according to others. They seem
        prone to dissolving into some strong-smelling vinegar-like substance
        with age. I am not sure how feasible it would be to replace the LCD
        with something newer. But I do believe that it might be possible to
        hijack the external RGB output from the back of it and feed it back
        in, if you were dedicated and could find a tiny panel that would
        accept its resolution. I have not seen evidence of people doing this
        (although I did not look particularly hard for such evidence either).
      </p>
      <p>
        They should be usable as desktop machines plugged into an external
        screen, but why not just get a desktop with actual C-bus card support
        at that point?
      </p>
      <p>
        I love the idea of the laptops. And the looks. I'm just not sure which
        if any of them are not prone to dissolving their own screens and
        haven't spent quite enough time researching them. If you are certain
        that your screens won't decay and you have a choice between a TFT and
        an STN panel, take a TFT. Unless you like and feel nostalgic for how
        blurry early color LCD's were (and for the really bad viewing angles
        and contrast dials). I think they're kind of neat; my thinkpad 350 has
        an STN panel.
      </p>
      <p>
        It may be worth noting that it appears at least <i>some</i> laptops
        can have an expansion box plugged in containing multiple C-bus slots.
        So if you want to set up a laptop as a desktop, this may actually
        be feasible. I don't know what those parts cost now, however.

      <p>
        A lot of this section will likely be common sense, but I still think
        that that common sense is only 'common' if you already happen to know
        a bit about how these computers are put together. So perhaps not as
        much to a westerner like myself. If I sound like I'm babying you,
        that is not my intent; I just would rather say too much than not
        enough.
      </p>
      <h3 id="pc9801_buying_wyatt_the_surprises">Surprises Upon Arrival</h3>
      <p>
        You can only prepare for so much. Not all sellers necessarily can be
        expected to think to or know how to open up the case of the PC, for
        example, or even do something basic, like taking a good picture of the
        back of the computer where all the cards and ports are (and where the
        model sticker usually is).
      </p>
      <p>
        In my case, there were several pleasant surprises inside.
      </p>
      <div class="imgcontain imgwrap" id="pc9801_buying_wyatt_surprise_486dx4">
        <a href="pc9801_1/full/surprise_boards.jpg">

               alt="My Epson PC-486GR with the case opened, showing extra RAM
                    board and CPU accelerator (486 DX4)"/>
        </a>
        <div class="imgwrap caption imgcentercaption">
          That blower fan is definitely not stock. The RAM card (right)
          isn't, either.
          <br/>
          I wasn't expecting any of these bonuses!
        </div>
      </div>
      <p>
        My PC-486GR was bought with a description basically equating to "it
        worked when it was stored a long time ago." No other details were
        given as to the particulars, and only exterior pictures were taken.
      </p>
      <p>
        When I opened it, there was more than anticipated to be happy about in
        there. Namely, the badge on the front plate of the computer (which
        is an Epson factory upgrade sticker proclaiming the presence of a 50MHz
        486DX2 inside) was a lie... in a pretty good way. It actually had a
        75MHz 486DX4 inside! Epson never offered a DX4 upgrade for this
        computer, from what I can tell; this accelerator board is from a
        company called "Asset Core" and it appears it may not have been
        marketed for very long. There are few pictures or bits of documentation
        of my specific accelerator on the web that I have been able to find.
      </p>
      <p>
        This makes it run a <i>wee</i> bit fast for some older titles, even on
        the slowest clock speed option. Removing the 486DX4 made my computer
        fall back to the 25MHz 486SX soldered to the CPU card, but I've not
        been able to find a jumper as of yet to allow me to more easily disable
        the DX4. If I could find one, I could attach the jumper to a toggle
        switch on the back of the case to easily switch between CPU's (at
        boot time). As it is, I'm considering looking for another 486GR just
        for that reason. -_-
      </p>
      <p>
        The CPU card additionally has both RAM slots filled. I think that
        supplies maybe 4 or 8 megabytes.
      </p>
      <p>
        There's also a Buffalo ERB-4000 RAM board in there; it has 4MB on-board
        and two empty slots that I could put sticks in if Epson-type RAM were
        not unobtainium.
      </p>
      <p>
        More generally, here's some things (a non-exhaustive list) to look for
        when you open your machine.
      </p>
      <h4>How much RAM?</h4>
      <p>
        The seller might not mention how much RAM it has. Hopefully, it has at
        least some, because PC-98 RAM (NEC PC-98 RAM) in general is not a
        standard pinout.
      </p>
      <p>
        For NEC-made computers, It can actually cause damage to the RAM and/or
        computer if you try to plug a standard JEDEC-compliant SIMM RAM stick
        into it (like the rest of the world used at the time), since the ground
        and power pins are not in the expected locations.
      </p>
      <p>
        The situation is a <i>little</i> better with the Epson models, where
        a JEDEC SIMM ram stick at least shares the same power pins, but JEDEC
        still won't <i>work</i> in an Epson due to different data and/or
        address lines.
      </p>
      <p>
        Unfortunately, <i>again</i>, Japan is xenophobic and only lets Japanese
        citizens get access to the National Diet Library, which is what
        <a href="http://98epjunk.shakunage.net/memory/make_ep_simm.html">
        at least least one person who wrote instructions</a> tells you to do.

        On a side note, I would claim that allowing digital access to
        foreigners would only promote cross cultural understanding and cost the
        Japanese government next to nothing, since it is the ultimate arbiter
        of copyright law.  But everyone is seemingly terrified of copyright
        laws on decades-old newspapers and magazines. Not to say that copyright
        as a concept is inherently bad/wrong; that's another debate I don't
        want to get into (although it is fun to banter about). But I think it
        is inarguably harmful to us in this specific case, and the subject
        matter is no longer commercially relevant in the slightest and there
        aren't reprintings being made to sell, to my knowledge.
      </p>
      <p>
        Anyway, borders are dumb and arbitrary, promote an "us and them"
        mentality, and generally cause more harm than good. Thank you for
        coming to my TED talk.

        <b><i>SO, ANYWAY&hellip;</i></b>
      </p>
      <p>
        Back on topic, obviously I can't
        <i>&quot;just become Japanese, lol&quot;</i>
        and magically get legal access to that document without physically
        travelling across half the globe to the National Diet and then
        potentially having to yank a random Japanese citizen off the streets to
        get the paper on my behalf. So I'm not going to do that to get the
        pinout of some RAM.
      </p>
      <p>
        If anyone with access to a copy of pages 370 to 374 of the July 1997
        issue of <i>Transistor Technology</i> can summarise the details for
        me, though, you'd be doing the world a great service.
      </p>
      <p>
        Thankfully after hours of searching I was
        <a href="https://projectmps.net/simmepson.htm">able to find a pinout
          for Epson SIMM ram</a>. No thanks to that other person.
        Where was I going with this? - oh, right. <b>It's possible that someone
        took the RAM out of your PC.</b> I haven't seen this happen yet, but
        with a "junk" listing it'd be only too easy to do it and sell the RAM
        separately. Maybe if that's the case, you can modify a JEDEC stick to
        fit an Epson PC-98 clone by cutting traces and running wires.

      <h3 id="pc9801_buying_wyatt_expansion_cards">Expansion Cards</h3>
      <h4 id="pc9801_buying_wyatt_cards_hdd">Hard Drive Controllers</h4>
      <p>
        My PC does not have an IDE or SCSI controller built in, although some
        variants of it did come with one. There's an unused card edge slot in
        the case that can be hooked to a proprietary Epson card, which I
        believe uses SCSI and also houses a hard drive in a metal cage
        alongside it. I didn't see one on Yahoo Auctions, but did see that the
        cards have sold on there once in a while in the past. It might actually
        be a SASI card (pre-SCSI but basically compatible); I have read
        conflicting reports on that subject.
      </p>
      <p>
        The lack of that card is not a deal-breaker, because there's also
        C-Bus, which is the also-proprietary, but-at-least-publicly-documented
        slot NEC put on the PC-98 series for end-user expansions. C-Bus SCSI
        controllers exist and can be used to boot a hard drive, even on
        computers where a proprietary hard drive interface is also provided.
        Mine came with one, although I had trouble making it work. I have a
        feeling it was a termination issue, since it looks to only have
        passive termination on it.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you want to get a SCSI C-bus card, it seems that it would be best to
        get one that can be compatible with the PC-9801-55 (which is the
        'standard' that most or all bootable SCSI controllers seem to follow).
      </p>
      <p>
        There's a fair bit of configuration that many cards require to be done
        via DIP switches. I sort of understand this, since the main thing to
        do is ensure that no cards have overlapping addresses or interrupts,
        but sometimes the finer points elude me. It would be a good idea to
        take a picture of any cards you get before you start messing with the
        switches so you can restore to the configuration it came to you in.
      </p>
      <p>
        One interesting thing to note about these cards that I have not seen
        mentioned in the English speaking world yet is that the little plastic
        tab on some cards which presses a switch next to the slot to indicate
        that the card should be treated as a 24-bit addressable card instead of
        a 20-bit addressable one. If I understand correctly.
      </p>

          Note the plastic doohickey on two of these cards. This presses down a
          switch that is present in some PC-98 models.
        </div>
      </div>
      <p>
        Apparently some later 24-bit addressable cards don't have the button
        presser anymore, and some later 9821s don't have the switch installed
        on all slots but just assume a card is 24-bit addressable if it is
        present. I swapped a 'button presser' onto the card closest to the
        camera from the one in the middle and behavior did not seem to change,
        but the card closest to the camera did already have a spot for me to
        screw the lever thing into it, so it was clearly designed with the
        intent of using one at some point.
      </p>
      <p>
        Don't peel those stickers off the brown chips, by the way. Those cover
        up EPROM (Erasable Programmable Read-Only Memory) quartz windows, and
        if exposed to the right light frequencies (somewhere in the ultraviolet
        range) the chip will be erased and the card won't operate properly.
        If you happen to have an EPROM programmer and the correct pin adapters,
        it'd be really great of you to dump the cards' ROMs and share them,
        too, because they could lose their data naturally even without light
        exposure at some point and need reprogramming. I sort of doubt the
        manufacturers care enough or even have the files (if the still exist)
        to help you out. Once the chips have lost their marbles, it's too late,
        unless someone's made a backup and can re-program them.

          Both of my SCSI controllers have a 50 pin "mini centronics" connector
          like this.<br/>
          I see some Japanese people call it "half amphenol" as well, and
          Wikipedia calls it an 'HPCN50.'
        </div>
      </div>
      <p>
        It uses a "half-sized amphenol" (mini-centronics) connector, which is
        not a common SCSI connector here in the States but which seems to have
        been rather popular with Japanese manufacturers instead of the "HD50"
        miniaturized D-sub that most stuff seems to have used here. The
        LHA-301<b>A</b> uses a more common HD50 connector, but I did not see
        one for sale, and after reading descriptions of various SCSI controller
        options online the 301 and 301A seemed like some of my best bets. They
        even support "PnP" ("plug-n-play") in Windows, and support up through
        Windows 2000. If I upgrade the BIOS ROM (not sure how exactly to do
        that) from 1.05 to 1.07, it seemingly can support up to 8GB SCSI
        drives. LHA-301 also supports three data transfer methods for
        interacting with the host system: PIO (the simplest, where the CPU is
        involved with every byte read in), DMA (direct memory access, which
        bypasses the CPU and writes directly to addresses in RAM so the CPU can
        work on other things), and SMIT (I have <i>absolutely no idea</i> what
        this is, but it seems to be the consensus of Japanese documentation
        I've found that it's faster than both DMA and PIO). I have mine
        configured for DMA right now and haven't had issues. I think there may
        be a DOS driver I need to install to actually make use of it, but I
        haven't done so, since I haven't felt too throttled by disk I/O yet and
        am just glad it's working so stably right now.
      </p>
      <p>
        I had to switch it out of "MO" (magneto-optical?) mode in order to make
        the DOS installer see and initialize it properly - I guess maybe a past
        owner was using it with a magneto-optical drive. The 130mm ones seem
        pretty cool. But I'm not getting one right now! - I've spent enough on
        this thing as it is!
      </p>
      <p>
        This card has a software-based configurator (accessed by holding
        ctrl+grph+L during boot) instead of DIP switches; I think it's really
        nifty. It also <i>actually works</i> for me (as opposed to the
        IF-55TB), which is also pretty nifty.

        boards). I believe this is because the 9801V board requires the PC to
        send a "READY" signal to the keyboard before the board will send any
        key events to the host computer. Later boards apparently do not require
        this. <b>I could not even enter the configuration screen with the 9801V
        board, and had to switch to my rubber dome Epson to do so.</b> There is
        one generation of PC-9801 mechanical keyboard after the 9801V series,
        so I cannot confirm or deny if those work. The difference there is that
        the lock keys don't mechanically latch downwards ('alternate action')
        when engaged. They also have the extra 'function keys' that are lacking
        on the 9801V board. <b>There is a chance that these later mechanical
        keyboards will work,</b> but I can only guarantee that my 1992 rubber
        dome Epson board (and probably rubber dome NEC boards from around then
        onwards) can be used to configure the LHA-301.
      </p>
      <p>
        So, if you don't want to have two keyboards sitting around, you may
        need to avoid the LHA-301, accept that you will be using a mushy rubber
        dome board, or maybe try that final generation of mechanical boards
        with the extra function keys and non-latching lock keys.
      </p>
      <p>
        This is the only time I have found a problem with using the 9801V board
        - Everything else I have tried works fine with it. I'm just glad I
        already had successfully configured it with the Epson board, or I would
        have probably not recognized that the keyboard was the problem.
      </p>
      <p>
        From what I can see, the
        difference might be that the 55TB doesn't seem to have a voltage
        regulator on board, which is a prerequisite for active SCSI bus
        termination (the better kind). If I have an active terminator on one
        end and a passive resistor pack terminator on the other, that might
        explain why it behaves erratically.

        There's one thing it can't do, which is the PC-98's "Hi-Res"

        this mode ever got much use, and later Windows-era machines had a
        different, incompatible solution for higher-resolution display. Since
        I don't know what I'd use it for, it doesn't bother me yet.

      <h4>Sound Cards</h4>
      <p>
        There are a few different kinds of sound cards available for the PC-98
        series. I currently only have a dead PC-9801-86 that needs new
        capacitors and a working MPU-PC98II; 26 sound is integrated into my
        PC's main board.
      </p>
      <p>
        <span id="pc9801_buying_wyatt_cards_sound_fm86"><b>86 Sound:</b></span><br/>
        If you are lucky, your system will already have a PC-9801-86
        compatible sound chip (YM2608, or OPNA), or even the full PC-9801-86
        C-Bus board installed. There are also a handful of clones of the
        PC-9801-86 that exist, but they don't seem especially common online.
        The -86 board is common, but also expensive. If you can, I'd suggest
        looking for a computer with a built-in "86 sound" chip. On With98
        (see <a href="#pc9801_buying_wyatt_links_japanese">links</a>),
        these are represented with something like "YM2608," "86 sound,"
        or mentions of PCM or ADPCM capability. I think it was introduced
        alongside the PC-9821 series, or perhaps very shortly thereafter.
        Most 9821 models should have it, I think.
      </p>
      <p>
        An "86 sound" compatible system will get you PCM audio support, which
        is a massive upgrade that allows for things like voice acting, or
        things like sound effects in Windows 3.1 (if you're into that).
        It also gets you stereo FM synthesis sound and PCM recording
        capabilities. In the long term, it's a nice thing to have.
      </p>
      <p>
        It has a single DE9 (often mistakenly called DB9) connector for
        a joystick using the Atari joystick pinout. Thus it may be usable with
        a Sega Master System or potentially a Mega Drive pad as well.
        Due to the exact way the Mega Drive sends out button presses, it may
        be possible for it to behave strangely. This is because of the hack
        Sega did to get that many buttons on a backward compatible controller,
        and it depends basically on how fast the controller is being polled
        if it works properly or not. Some buttons might still work fine,
        though.

      <p>
        <span id="pc9801_buying_wyatt_cards_sound_fm26"><b>26 Sound:</b></span><br/>
        An earlier sound card, the PC-9801-26 (or PC-9801-26K), will get you
        mono FM synthesis sound and no PCM playback. It is based on the YM2203C
        OPN chip. My Epson PC-486GR has one of these integrated into it, as do
        many other early 90's and perhaps late 80's PC-98 models. If you're on
        a budget, be reassured that most games I have tried support it, and
        especially for the earlier DOS games (from the 80's) that I am most
        interested in it's all you will need. It does not however have PCM,
        and it is mono sound only.
      </p>
      <p>
        The PC-9801-26K has more clones available than the -86 seems to. It's
        also a fair deal cheaper to find a 26K card.
      </p>
      <p>
        It has two DE9 (often mistakenly called DB9) connectors for joysticks
        in the "Atari joystick" button configuration. This means it can be
        used with Sega Master System pads, or possibly Mega Drive pads.

        <span id="pc9801_buying_wyatt_cards_sound_soundblaster"><b>Sound Blaster:</b></span><br/>
        There is a Sound Blaster card for the PC-98, using an OPL3 chip and
        very much analogous to the ISA sound blaster 16's in IBM compatibles. I
        don't have a clue what software uses it, but there you have it. It does
        exist. It also has IBM-style joystick connectors ("gameport
        connectors"). Neither I nor my friend currently have any of these

        <span id="pc9801_buying_wyatt_cards_sound_midi"><b>MIDI:</b></span><br/>
        Some stuff, especially later in the PC-98's lifetime, seems to adopt
        MIDI sound. I am not aware of too many (if any) cards that perform
        on-board MIDI synthesis, so you will likely need an external
        synthesizer. One cheapish way to do that, once you have a MIDI card,
        would be to get a good quality USB MIDI adapter for a modern PC and
        run a software MIDI synth like timidity on it, and then connect
        a MIDI cable between the PC-98 and the modern PC. If you pick the
        right soundfont, that's enough to get you basically a Roland Sound
        Canvas. A lot of games use "GS" (Roland's General MIDI extension)
        or General MIDI instrument mappings, so that should get you a long way.
        Some games also use the Roland MT-32, which <b>is not</b> GS
        compatible. You could perhaps use MUNT (which emulates the MT-32 pretty
        well) for this, if you can legally obtain the ROM chips and dump them.
        That way, you just need to connect your PC-98 to a modern PC and have
        the modern PC perform the MIDI synthesis for you.
      </p>
      <p>
        You could also hunt down a physical Roland Sound Canvas (SC-55mkII
        and SC-88 seem to be popular options) for the GS games. For the MT-32,
        an actual MT-32 is ideal; a D-110 might also work, but the sounds will
        be different (arguably, the D-110 has better samples - but it will not
        represent what the games were actually designed to sound like, even if
        the instrument ID's mostly match up). The D-110 is also <i>huge</i> by
        comparison to an MT-32, since the D-110 is 19" rack mounted equipment.

        <span id="pc9801_buying_wyatt_midi_sound_canvas"><b>Roland Sound Canvas:</b></span><br/>
        I just recently got a Roland SC-55K, which is based on the SC-55mkii
        but lacks a screen and most of the buttons of the actual SC-55mkii.
        It's a unit meant for karaoke, is Japan-exclusive, and is also
        basically an enhanced version of the SC-55ST. The 55ST, unlike the
        SC-55K, has no MIDI thru or MIDI out ports to speak of. So if you're
        choosing between a 55ST and a 55K, I'd suggest the 55K. It's just
        a 55ST, but with more I/O. For the non-Karaoke features, you can just
        use the SC-55ST manual for directions and it'll get you where you need
        to go, since the 55ST is a strict subset of the 55K's functionality.
      </p>
      <p>
        Don't be tempted into thinking you can just use your PC's serial port
        as a MIDI interface; most software doesn't seem to allow doing this,
        even though the 55mkII, 55ST, and 55K all support MIDI over RS232.
        Things really expect you to have an MPU interface, unfortunately for
        your wallet.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you get a 55ST or 55K, and your software <i>does</i> support MIDI
        over RS232 on a PC-98, you want to use the "PC-1" position for the
        switch on the back. The
        <a href="http://lib.roland.co.jp/support/jp/manuals/res/2209091700/SC-55K_j.pdf">55K's Japanese manual</a>
        says that the "PC-1" position is for the "PC-9800 series," whereas
        the
        <a href="http://cdn.roland.com/assets/media/pdf/SC-55ST_OM.pdf">English
        manual for the 55ST</a> omits that and just mentions in a note
        that "PC-1" is for a 31.25Kbps connection. Otherwise, it basically
        glosses over the existance of the "PC-1" setting and emphasizes the use
        of "PC-2" for IBM compatibles (PC/AT class).
      </p>
      <p>
        The SC-55 and family are GS MIDI synths; if a game asks you to choose
        between "GS" and some other sound formats (perhaps "26", "86", and
        "MT"), "GS" pretty much means the Sound Canvas series in this context.
      </p>
      <p>
        I've run my 55K with the original Roland 100V-in power brick
        straight from a wall outlet (around 120V) without issue, but I
        typically use my stepdown transformer to be safe. See
        <a href="#pc9801_buying_wyatt_power_converters">the relevant section</a>
        about powering Japanese domestic electronics.
      </p>
      <p>
        For the record, the SC-55K,and presumably the SC-55mkii, ask for
        a 9 volt DC, <b>tip/center-negative</b> power connection. This is the
        same as an MT-32, a Famicom, a Super Famicom/European SNES, or a Sega
        Master System, and almost the same as a Sega Genesis (<b>model I</b>
        only). So if you don't want/can't use a stepdown transformer, or
        weren't given the original power brick with your Japanese-imported
        unit, you can use any of the above power bricks as a substitute.
        The extra one volt or so of the Genesis power brick will be burned off
        as extra heat by the 7805 voltage regulator that the Sound Canvas uses.
        You could probably even use a 12v <b>center negative</b> brick and it'd
        work. If you encounter problems with this, the 12 volts might be
        overheating the regulator. Let it cool down and use a lower voltage
        brick.
      </p>
      <p>
        You can also get a new power brick for it; I've had luck with the
        Triad Magnetics
        <a href="https://catalog.triadmagnetics.com/item/wall-plug-in-transformers/wall-plug-ins-switch-mode-power-supplies/wsu090-1300-r">WSU090-1300-R</a>
        power adapter, which I've been buying through Digi-key. It can also be
        bought from Mouser - or even Console5, apparently. I typically don't
        use Console5, but maybe it's worth it if there's some other old game
        console stuff you need. I've only once bought something from it, and
        that was for making my own Wii S-Video cord.
      </p>
      <p>
        This isn't meant as a promotion for the Triad over any other supply;
        just as an easy option that is readily commercially available if
        someone doesn't want to do the legwork to figure out all the specs on
        their own. Anything that can deliver at least one watt at 9 volts
        DC, has a negative tip/positive shell polarity arrangement, uses an
        approximately 2.1mm x 5.5mm x 11mm plug, and accepts your local voltage
        as an input should work.
      </p>
      <p>
        Note that the '-R' at the end of the product model name is important.
        <b>The non-'-R' version of this supply is positive-tipped, and will
        quite possibly damage your hardware.</b> So if you're looking for one
        on other sites like eBay or Amazon, make sure it's the '-R' version.

        <span id="pc9801_buying_wyatt_midi_mt32"><b>Roland MT-32:</b></span><br/>
        I have also seen some software that supports the earlier Roland MT-32.
        Thankfully, I've had one of those for about five or six years now. I
        can't really recommend buying an MT-32 at today's market prices,
        though. I think there was a Raspberry Pi project I saw to emulate an
        MT-32 which looks much more affordable. And MUNT (the software MT-32
        emulator people use) is getting pretty good. The only inaccuracy I've
        noted (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kng3Rfn2tBk">I arrange
        music on my MT-32</a>) are that sometimes my real (early revision)
        MT-32 drops notes that MUNT will play correctly - I have never felt
        that something felt wrong due to this extra polyphony. My early
        revision MT-32 also can't handle system exclusive messages in rapid
        succession like later revisions of the hardware (or MUNT) can. So in a
        lot of ways, I'd argue, MUNT is actually better than the real thing.
      </p>
      <p>
        That won't make me stop loving my MT-32, but it is a reason that I
        don't think it's truly necessary to own one. If you can find a legal
        way to obtain the ROM chips, that should be enough. Maybe someone on
        ebay will sell the original chips harvested from dead hardware once in
        a while? I'd guess that that would count as owning a legitimate copy of
        the copyrighted information to make your own ROM dumps from. MUNT
        <i>does</i> require ROM dumps to work, unfortunately.
      </p>
      <p>
        The MT-32 uses the same power input as the Sound Canvas SC-55. Read
        the section on the Sound Canvas for more information.

        <span id="pc9801_buying_wyatt_midi_mpu401"><b>MPU Card:</b></span><br/>
        Just having a synthesizer isn't enough. You also need a way to connect
        it to your computer! On IBM compatibles, one would initially have used
        a Roland MPU-401 box with MIF-IPC or MIF-IPC-A (compatible with faster
        computers) ISA card. On a PC-98 series computer, this would be an
        MPU-401 box and Roland MIF-PC98 card.
      </p>
      <p>
        Later on, the MPU-401 was integrated into the interface card,
        eliminating the external box entirely. For an IBM compatible, this
        would be a Roland MPU-401AT ISA card; for the PC-98 there were the
        MPU-PC98 and MPU-PC98II cards. From what I gather (<b>this may easily
        be wrong</b>; this is information gathered from hearsay), the main
        difference between the MPU-PC98 and MPU-PC98II cards is that the 98II
        has DIP switches to change IRQ settings (a big deal!). Perhaps some
        bugs were also fixed; I can't find any concrete evidence on this front
        from a cursory search.
      </p>
      <p>
        I bought an MPU-PC98II interface, which lets me eliminate the need for
        an expensive external box and also lets me change IRQ's. It may be
        argued that given the simplicity of the interface cards and
        availability of brand new cards for interfacing with the external
        MPU-401 boxes, I should have bought that version instead so I could
        share a single MPU-401 with IBM-compatibles. That's a fair point,
        except that currently my only working IBM compatible with externally
        facing ISA slots is an AT&amp;T 6300 (8086-based) PC, which is quite
        a bit older than I'd want for music. My Pentium III Gateway has a
        single ISA slot, but it's not got an exposed bracket, strangely. And
        the Pentium III can probably(?) use MIDI out over a Sound Blaster Live!
        PCI card, anyway, which incorporates much of the MPU-401's
        functionality and cost me far less (as far as I can remember, it was
        free). I don't know if the "intelligent mode" of the MPU-401 is
        emulated there, though.
      </p>
      <p>
        The "intelligent mode" of the MPU-401 uses an 8 track sequencer,
        sync and metronome outputs, and possibly other things. The alternative
        is the simpler "UART mode," where the MPU-401 basically acts like a
        dumb 31250 baud serial port. I don't know that I've personally ever
        had trouble, but it's something other people on the internet always are
        warning people about regarding USB adapters with old synths like the
        MT-32. Maybe my USB adapter has that 'intelligent mode?' - It's the
        Roland UM-One. Some of the other USB adapters I've tried <i>are</i>
        prone to dropping notes. Maybe that's why. I'm out of my element here.
        It appears that emulators like DOSBox and Neko Project 2 Kai support
        MPU-401 emulation in software (and thus should be usable with a dumb UART
        USB adapter).
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm not aware of any hardware MPU cards that <i>don't</i> come from
        Roland for C-Bus, so maybe it's irrelevant to worry about intelligent
        mode MPU-401 support.

        don't have a huge amount of money to do so, I'd say the SC-55 or
        similar is a better purchase for a wider variety of games. If you
        <i>do</i> have a huge amount of money, get a CM-500 which contains both
        an MT-32 and a SC-55.
      </p>
      <p>
        And if you have a truly <i>enormous</i> sum of money, and you want
        to thank me for writing this, I of course wouldn't say no to being
        offered a little of it. ;)
      </p>
      <p>
        Of course, I also appreciate a written 'thank you,' even without
        monetary transactions. It's also a great motivator to keep writing
        if I know I'm helping people.

      <p>
        So excited you can't sit still? Need to do something during the
        torturous wait for the day the huge expensive box arrives at your door?
      </p>
      <p>
        Well, lucky you. There's a lot you still need to have ready besides the
        box itself.
      </p>
      <h4 id="pc9801_buying_wyatt_power_converters">Power Converters</h4>
      <p>
        At the risk of promoting FUD, I will point out/remind you that the
        Japanese power grid runs at 100 volts AC (at either 50 or 60 Hz).
        You shouldn't have to worry about frequency regardless of where you
        live, but if you aren't in Japan itself you <i>may</i> want to or
        need to invest in a step-down power transformer.        
      </p>
      <p>
        Japan's mains voltage is the lowest in the world, and it is the only
        country that uses this voltage. It's possibly close enough to the US
        power grid's 110, 115, or 120 volts - seemingly depending on who you
        ask, the specific year, and several other details. It seems that the
        standard in the US is now 120 volts, but that prior to sometime in the
        1970's most regions used 110 to 115 volts. Regardless, we now use 120
        volts, which is of course 20% higher than the power supply in your
        PC-98 was designed and rated for use with.
      </p>
      <p>
        This <i>might</i> be fine, and if it is it would certainly save you
        some money if you live in a &lt;=120V country. But your computer's
        power supply would at a minimum run hotter than it was expected to
        by the engineers who designed it, and at worst have a reduced service
        life or cause some somewhat low-rated capacitor to pop (remember that
        electrolytic capacitors often have huge margins of error on them on the
        magnitude of 20%). I'm guessing that a respectable company like NEC
        would not have used the bare minimum capacitor ratings, but these
        caps are still old unless you replace them, and a nice Japanese-made
        step-down transformer can be had for $100 or less to remove some of
        the nervousness that I would have plugging it in directly.
      </p>
      <p>
        I have successfully run a Roland SC-55K with its original Japanese
        100V rated power brick directly on US wall power, but I still am
        using it with a stepdown now - after I realized that I'd just been
        using an incorrectly specified Japanese domestic wall wart. You guys
        in Europe are kind of lucky, in a way: it'd be a <b>lot</b> harder to
        accidentally plug a Japanese power cord/brick directly into your wall.
        Here in the states, it is quite easy to do absentmindedly.
      </p>
      <p>
        I do recommend labelling your power cables on both ends - down by the
        plugs and up by where they plug into your equipment. I used blue
        painter's tape to make them stand out. This way, I am hopefully
        reminded that there is something special about the plug I'm holding if
        I ever need to rearrange the cables under my desk.
      </p>
      <p>
        If your PSU happens to have text on the back stating that it is rated
        for at least your voltage, then ignore everything I just said. But
        my Epson at least only specifies 100V at 50 or 60 Hz.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you are in Europe, you will almost certainly have to get a step-down
        transformer, unless there's some industrial PSU for PC-98's used
        with something like CNC machines that I'm unaware of and your
        machine came from somewhere like that rather than from Japan.
      </p>
      <p>
        I went a little pricier with mine and bought a used Sanyo TSD-N11LU
        transformer, with a nice "capacity indicator" and a rating of
        1100 Volt-Amps (not QUITE the same as saying 11 watts, in this case,
        apparently, but I don't know why that is. ) If your PC, monitor, and
        anything else Japanese that you are running off of your transformer
        totals less than the rated wattage, you should be fine. To be safe, I
        recommend going significantly higher than the minimum; things like hard
        drives draw a lot of power draw at spin-up, which might be fine for a
        short period of time, but I've seen stuff fail from excessive current
        draw when spinning up a bunch of disks before. I'd also just suggest
        trying not to stress your hardware, since it'll be expensive to ship
        more of it if you break it - assuming you can even find exactly your
        computer or whatever it is you are trying to replace. It also provides
        future-proofing; part of my reason for going high was in case I ended
        up importing a CRT (which I did).
      </p>
      <p>
        If you can find an isolation transformer, that's especially nice, since
        while heavy it means you don't have to worry about earth grounding it
        at the wall outlet.
      </p>
      <h4>Accessories that Use AC Adapters</h4>
      <p>
        For accessories for your PC-98, if they use a DC barrel jack, you may
        be better off if you get a new wall wart that is simply correctly
        specced for your mains voltage and desired output/plug size. I
        mentioned the correct AC adapter for the Roland MT-32 and SC-55 above,
        for instance. This way, you don't have to worry about getting a power
        strip or similar for your stepdown transformer. Most of the good ones
        (non-Chinese) don't have a ground prong on their outlets, so most
        US spec power taps won't (safely) be able to cut it. You might have
        to import a Japanese strip, or use a US "cheater plug" with a wire
        strapped to that metal contact underneath that runs to a ground point
        on the stepdown transformer.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you want to get something new and of reasonably good quality, I'd
        suggest ordering on Digi-key or Mouser - or at least searching for part
        numbers by doing that and then buying what you find by narrowing down
        your search off of somewhere like ebay, or maybe your local hobby
        store, if your hobby shop will get stuff like that for you.
      </p>
      <p>
        If your stuff comes with the original AC adapter, you can probably use
        it with your step-down transformer as well.
      </p>
      <h4>Using western 120/240V accessories with a 100V PC</h4>
      <p>
        Perhaps it's just on account of poor quality electronics in the
        housing, but if I have my external SCSI hard drive housing switched on
        prior to turning on my Epson, the epson comes up with a "VR Failure"
        error (which I assume means "Voltage Regulator"). When using a ZuluSCSI
        board in the housing, I don't have to connect the 120V AC cable to the
        housing since it's powered by the SCSI controller's "TERMPWR"
        (Termination Power). Doing this, I can sidestep the error. I can also
        simply turn on the PC prior to flipping on the power switch on the
        housing and then press reset on the PC, and that also works.
      </p>
      <p>
        Why does this happen? I honestly don't know. I suspect it has something to do
        with the two devices not sharing a common earth ground, perhaps. Or
        maybe the power supply design inside my drive housing is of
        questionable quality? It's not a name branded thing, so that wouldn't
        be <i>entirely</i> surprising to me. But the output voltages are pretty
        much on the dot (checked with my Fluke 77 multimeter).
      </p>
      <p>
        Obviously, <i>something</i> weird is going on, so if you come across
        problems like this, I'd suggest trying to avoid using those
        accessories, but I've yet to find that I've actually hurt anything by
        doing this. Maybe it's just that the disk drive is trying to provide
        termination power and that's messing something up with the power supply
        to the C-bus cards? It might not be 120V related at all.
      </p>
      <p>
        In general, I think you'll probably be fine to use your domestic stuff
        with it, as long as nothing has a hot chassis (you have bigger problems
        if you have stuff with metal casing that does this; I don't think
        anything you'd want to use with a PC-98 would have a hot chassis
        construction, so it's not something to worry about). It can be a good
        way to save some money, if you can find domestic printers, scanners,
        serial terminals, external CD drives/external hard drives, and so on.
      </p>
      <p>
        &hellip;Actually, my modern desktop PC (which runs on 120V) is hooked
        to my PC-98 via a null modem serial cable, and it doesn't give a
        voltage regulator error message, so it's probably just some peculiarity
        of my SCSI controller or drive housing or configuration.

      <h3 id="pc9801_buying_wyatt_mouse">Mouse</h3>
      <p>
        Did your PC come with a mouse? If not, you need to get one for a lot of
        newer software.
      </p>
      <p>
        First off, you can't use a serial mouse. Well, maybe you <i>can</i>,
        at least in Windows, but if you are trying to run DOS programs I don't
        know if there's any TSR or similar software to make a serial mouse
        work. I also would expect that even if there is some workaround like
        this (akin to CTMOUSE/Cutemouse in western DOS), no DOS programs for
        the PC-98 are going to be programmed with such drivers in mind and
        may cause resource conflicts. Basically, I wouldn't even try, and
        consider it a bad idea, given the relative ease with which you can
        get a fully-compatible mouse.
      </p>
      <p>
        What you <i>actually</i> need to look for is commonly termed a
        "bus mouse." These mouses just send raw signals from the optical
        gate sensors on the X and Y axis rollers of a ball mouse over a
        wire back to the host computer, with no encoding like PS/2 mouses use.
        Pinouts varied, so not <i>all</i> things that could be arguably termed
        "bus mouses" will work, but anything made for IBM PC's probably will.
      </p>
      <p>
        The term "bus mouse" refers to the fact that early PC's had no built
        in mouse port, and so the user had to get or make an ISA card and link
        the mouse up to the computer's ISA bus. When used outside of an IBM
        context, these mouses typically seem to be called something like
        "quadrature mouses" instead. The terms are largely interchangeable.
        Quadrature is a word to describe the four signals that a mouse will
        send out for ball movement (two infrared light sensors per axis).
      </p>
      <p>
        Here's the run down on the things you might need.
      </p>
      <h4>Mouse Card (Older Systems Only)</h4>
      <p>
        Older PC-98's might not have a mouse port, and for those you'd need
        to find a "bus mouse" card, I believe. This only applies to the ones
        made before around 1985. <a href="https://radioc.web.fc2.com/column/pc98bas/pc98kbdmouse_en.htm">
        This site</a> claims the PC-9801, the 9801E, 9801F, and 9801M models
        are the ones that need a mouse card. I don't have a PC-98 that old, so
        I haven't looked too hard, but I did not see any mouse controller cards
        with a cursory search when I tried. They're out there, but they might
        be somewhat uncommon. I'd expect that the early "green eyed" microsoft
        mouses came with cards, so maybe look for those? - Obviously, you'll
        need the C-bus version (not the ISA version the US and other countries
        got). It might be ASCII or NEC branded instead of Microsoft.
      </p>
      <p>
        You should note that most software that requires a mouse is probably
        new enough to need EGC, so these early PC-98 models will be pretty
        much useless in that capacity. The main reason to get a card would
        be for historical interest, I'd expect.
      </p>
      <p>
        These early C-Bus mouse cards should use the 9-pin D-Subminiature
        connector as described in the following section. You can of course make
        an adapter to use the mini-DIN variant connector with one. I have
        reason to believe that the IBM-compatible version of the Microsoft
        "green eyed" mouse used the same connector, so if you get a card
        without a mouse, that might be an option for you that will save on
        shipping... but I see that someone recently bought one for $80 on ebay
        without a card, so it may be a smarter idea to just import some other
        PC-98 mouse from Japan or make an adapter (see the following section).
      </p>
      <p>
        I've seen at least one NEC ad featuring the green eyed mouse, so it
        <i>could</i> be a period-correct part for an early PC-9801 model that
        needs a separate mouse card, if you're going for originality. Actually,
        it looks to me from a search like the model number for the original
        mouse bundle might be NEC's "<b>PC-9871</b>." It seems to include a
        Microsoft green eyed mouse. There were maybe other mouse interface
        boards released later&hellip; but the PC-9872R seems to be <i>just</i>
        a DE9 mouse without a card. So maybe not. The mouse port was integrated
        pretty early on; it seems like the only models that need a card are
        probably the original PC-9801, the 9801E* 9801F*, and 9801M* series.
        Later ones seem to have an integrated port. You should check that
        yourself before you take my word for it, but I believe this statement
        to be accurate.
      </p>
      <h4>Two Mouse Connectors</h4>
      <p>
        For later machines, you will probably have one of two possible
        connectors. The choices are a 9-pin D-Subminiature connector or a 9-pin
        mini-DIN connector. If you have the mini-DIN, it's the same pinout as a
        "Microsoft InPort" bus mouse for the US market, which is for mouses
        that connect via an ISA card. For this reason, searching ebay for
        a PC "bus mouse" can get you something electrically compatible with a
        PC-98. If it uses the D-Sub connector, you will need to make or get
        an adapter. I think the adapter will have to come from Japan, since
        the only western-market mouses that seems to <i>possibly</i> share this
        pinout are
        <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20010802062315id_/https://www.cs.rochester.edu/~kparkins/pinouts.txt">
        the original Microsoft "Green Eyed" bus mouse and perhaps a handful of
        Logitech ones</a>. I am not sure if passive adapters for connecting
        newer bus mouses to these older cards were ever widespread in the west,
        since we seem to have moved away from them far sooner than they did in
        Japan.

        <div class="imgwrap caption imgcentercaption">
          The two common PC-9801 mouse pinouts. Seemingly, these are shared
          with Microsoft bus mouses, although only the oldest of those use the
          DE9 connector.
        </div>
      </div>
      <p>
        It would sort of make sense if the pinout and D-sub connector were
        chosen to match Microsoft's original mouse pinout, since NEC seemed to
        cooperate pretty closely with ASCII Corporation (ASCII was basically
        Microsoft's Japanese arm). I have found evidence that a PC-9801 version
        of the "green eyed mouse" exists, and that there was a C-bus mouse
        controller card for it, too.
      </p>
      <p>
        You could try to rewire an Amiga or Atari ST or AT&amp;T
        6300 mouse (or other two-or-more-button quadrature mouse) and
        have it work. You could also
        <a href="http://oldcomputer.info/hacks/mouse/index.htm">try this guy's
        "universal bus mouse" idea,</a> and convert probably just about any old
        PS/2 ball mouse you might own into a bus mouse. Probably some early-ish
        optical PS/2 or USB ones, too, since some of those just imitated the
        quadrature signals from their sensor IC's so they could be used with
        existing PS/2 interface/controller chips as a drop-in upgrade for ball
        mouse designs.
      </p>
      <p>
        I opted to buy a mini-DIN mouse, the Logitech PC-93-9MD, from someone
        in Texas and then ordered a mouse adapter from Japan, since I was in
        no hurry but my particular PC-98 has a D-sub mouse connector. I also
        decided I didn't want to wire up my own this time, since making
        something both small and durable is tough, and the cost of shipping
        parts from Digikey is almost as bad as just buying a used adapter from
        halfway across the planet unless you have other things you're buying at
        the same time.
      </p>
      <p> 
        Does that defeat the point of buying a mouse domestically...?
      </p>
      <p>
        Well, maybe.
      </p>
      <p>
        But the price of PC-98 mouse from Japan was nearly as much as the Texas
        mouse, even without shipping fees. So I think I may have come out ahead
        just due to how small of an envelope the mouse adapter could fit in.
        And this mouse had one more button than most of the Japanese ones! -
        although I'm not sure what all will use it.

      <p>
        Your PC monitor may or may not work with the PC-98, as I have already
        alluded to. Its VGA connector almost certainly will not fit into the
        output on the PC-98, even if it is electrically compatible. Here is
        a drawing I made that corresponds to the adapters that I wired for
        myself and my friend.

        I am not 100% sure the ground wiring is all correct, so if you get
        noise definitely look first at pins 12 and 8 on the DA15 side and
        pins 5 and 10 on the VGA side. Perhaps I need to separate them from
        each other?

        According to the VGA pinout on Wikipedia, pin 5 on the VGA connector
        is supposed to be the ground specifically for the HSync signal, and
        pin 10 for the VSync signal. So if you can figure out which is which
        on the DA15 (PC-98) side (if any), then perhaps that will reduce noise.
      </p>
      <p>
        It looks fine on my CRT, though, which is why I have not bothered to
        mess with it much. I followed the DA15 pinout from
        <a href="https://radioc.web.fc2.com/column/pc98bas/pc98dispout2_en.htm">here</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Of course, there's also a solid chance your monitor will not be able to
        sync to the PC-98's 24KHz mode. If yours is like this, but you happen to
        have one that can sync to 15KHz (like my Commodore 1942 CRT or my Dell
        U2410 LCD), you can see if there's a DIP switch to make it output at
        15KHz. On my Epson, this switch exists on the front panel and is
        labelled <b>"HS24K."</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        When I first got this Epson, I had not yet bought a CRT and was hoping
        my LCD would do the job. Since 24KHz is in between 15KHz and 31KHz, I
        was a little hopeful, and I wired up my adapter while I waited for it
        to arrive.
      </p>
      <p>
        When it got here, I got nothing. But I was able to confirm operation by
        switching that DIP switch on the front panel, which made it show up on
        the Dell. I don't recommend just leaving it there, because a lot of
        stuff will break or work weirdly. It's not really a tenable long-term
        solution. Also, it introduces "scaling artifacts" such as uneven pixel
        widths, and most stuff that uses the higher color modes will be cut off
        halfway down the screen.
      </p>
      <p>
        Anyway, that happened, so I needed to get a CRT or a scaler (or another
        LCD). I ended up going for a CRT.
      </p>
      <p>
        Unfortunately, not all PC-98 monitors can sync at 24KHz either. Some of
        the later Windows 9821 monitors will <i>not</i> and run at 480p minimum
        (around 31Khz).
      </p>
      <p>
        Many if not all Sharp X68000 screens will also do 24KHz and can be
        used, by the way. The X68000 appears to use a compatible connector,
        too. Not sure about FM Towns, though. That's something that might be
        worth researching.
      </p>
      <p>
        Make sure the monitor you are looking for has <b>analogue RGB</b>, not
        just digital. Many older monitors have only digital RGB, which will
        limit the number of colors and types of software you can use.
      </p>
      <p>
        Additionally, finding a nicely priced one will be challenging, and you
        probably <b>will</b> get murdered on shipping. I won mine in an auction
        for $30 and paid <b>nearly ten times that much in shipping</b>, which
        was an unexpected surprise to say the least. I'd thought it'd be maybe
        $150 or so to ship. Apparently, Buyee re-packs stuff after inspection
        if you choose to have them inspect it, so I am nearly certain that
        Buyee's packaging is the reason it cost so much. For that reason,
        I am considering Buyee alternatives in the future, but we'll see.
        It did at least arrive very well protected and intact. But for a
        monitor that I bought 'untested' looking absolutely <i>filthy</i>,
        I don't know if I would have spent that much more in shipping had
        I been given a choice to not repack it.
      </p>
      <p>
        Unfortunately, my friend had already snagged what seems to have been
        the only really nice monitor at a fair price on the site, so I was left
        to deal with either super overpriced stuff or stuff that wasn't
        guaranteed to actually work, or overpriced stuff that I would
        definitely have to repair.

        I ended up deciding this filthy thing, an NEC PC-KD851 monitor, was my
        best bet for getting something that worked, since the seller said the
        screen would go bright when turned on or off. I operated under the
        principle that filthy untested stuff is more likely to be fine than
        spotless stuff that's tested and that the seller thinks is broken.

      <p>
        To be honest, most stuff I pick up tends to be fine, and it probably
        wouldn't have been kept around long enough to get so filthy if it
        hadn't worked back in the day when it was presumably stored away.
      </p>
      <p>
        The thing came, and it took <b>hours</b> of scrubbing at it with a damp

        The PC-KD851 was originally made for the PC-8801 series, it seems,
        rather than the 9801. Specifically, I've found a catalog scan that
        says it works with the PC-8801mkIISR, which indicates it's from around
        1985. But since it has an analogue RGB input, and since the 8801 also
        could output at 24KHz, I decided it had a good chance of being
        compatible. I think the seller also listed it as being PC-9801
        compatible, actually.
      </p>
      <p>
        The PC-KD861 appears to simply be a better version of the 851 that can
        also do 15 KHz. So I'd say that'd be one worth keeping an eye out for.
      </p>
      <p>
        Once again, this needed to be plugged into a stepdown transformer
        before I felt comfortable turning it on. Thankfully there's an outlet
        on the back of the Epson that I can use to daisy-chain it.

      <h3 id="pc9801_buying_wyatt_hdd">Getting a Hard Drive</h3>
      <p>
        If your PC-98 or compatible doesn't come with a hard drive, then you
        might need a SCSI controller.
      </p>
      <p>
        You might also need a parallel SCSI drive; these are getting tougher
        to find at good prices. A good long term solution might be to get
        something like a SCSI2SD, BlueSCSI, or ZuluSCSI board that can emulate
        one or multiple SCSI hard drives.
      </p>
      <p>
        I happen to have a 4GB Seagate Barracuda from 1996 that still works,
        but I also took this opportunity to get a ZuluSCSI board. I don't know
        how durable the SD cards will be, but they're a bit easier to get
        replacements for than nearly 30 year old HDD platters or bearings or
        spindle motors for sure.
      </p>
      <p>
        I stuck my ZuluSCSI board in an old external HDD enclosure to make it
        feel more period correct, even if it's much, much quieter. I think I'll
        use my Seagate as well, but I'm just not sure how often.

      <h3 id="pc9801_buying_wyatt_odd">Getting an Optical Drive</h3>
      <p>
        If you want to transfer files via CD, or play or install something
        distributed on CD, you may need to get a drive if your PC-98 doesn't
        have one. Much like hard drives, your main options (depending on your
        model of computer) are IDE drives and SCSI drives, as far as CD's are
        concerned. PC-9821's often (always?) came with IDE controllers; 9801's
        and Epsons didn't (although I think some of the last Epson 98's did).
      </p>
      <p><a href="#pc9801_buying_wyatt_toc">[Top]</a></p>
      <h4 id="pc9801_buying_wyatt_odd_ide">IDE Drives</h4>
      <p>
        Some later PC-98 models came with built-in IDE CD-ROM drives.
        If yours doesn't have one, but is late enough to be using
        IDE instead of SCSI, then there's a decent chance one might be
        able to be installed in an open bay, I'd think. In the Ce2 and
        CS2, it looks like the model is NEC CDR-260. They seem to have sold
        these drives in the 'States, so maybe you can remove the front bezel
        from one of the US-market ones and stick it in a '98 and have it work.
      </p>
      <p>
        If your PC-98's built-in optical drive isn't working, it may be broken.
        My friend got two systems, and one would not respond to the eject
        button or turn its LED on at all. The other one, from the unit in
        otherwise worse condition, would blink, and after she swapped the drive
        into her other unit it worked just fine.
      </p>
      <p>
        You might not be able to pick any old CD drive; they may look like
        "normal" IDE drives, but in the Ce2 and Cs2 at least, they <i>might</i>
        actually use some non-ATAPI command set. We aren't quite sure yet. I've
        seen one person suggest that the CDR-260 might be one of the
        <i>earliest</i> ATAPI compatible drives, but I can't guarantee
        anything. If it is truly an ATAPI drive, then I expect you could
        put in some other standard IDE CD drive and have it function, although
        you still might not be able to get one where the tray, LED, and eject
        button line up with the holes in the case. I'd be interested to know
        if anyone manages to finagle something into working!
      </p>
      <p><a href="#pc9801_buying_wyatt_toc">[Top]</a></p>
      <h4 id="pc9801_buying_wyatt_odd_scsi">SCSI Drives</h4>
      <p>
        The other option is a SCSI optical drive. Since my PC-486GR never came
        with an optical drive internally, and doesn't even have IDE, this is my
        only option. Working SCSI CD drives can be had for prices that aren't
        ludicrous still, but expect to pay about what you would for a used
        Blu-Ray writer drive for one (as of 2023).
      </p>
      <p>
        ZuluSCSI can also emulate a CD drive, if you are so inclined. As of now
        it looks like the boards currently on the market can't do CD Digital
        Audio (CDDA) playback, which would be a huge minus for me. maybe there'll be
        a hardware mod or something that I can do to retrofit it to mine, since
        there is now a hardware design (which has not been produced to my
        knowledge) that also carries CDDA.
      </p>
      <p>
        I don't know which if any PC-98 models used internal SCSI optical
        drives, but I don't have that option so I would be daisy chaining
        my CD drive to my SCSI bus after (or before) the hard drive.
        Make sure your hard drive (if applicable) and optical drive SCSI
        ID's don't overlap; you may have to adjust some jumpers or DIP switches
        or press a button on the casing of your drive to change this and avoid
        overlap.
      </p>
      <p>
        Then, with SCSI optical drives, the problem becomes making it work with
        DOS.

      <h4 id="pc9801_buying_wyatt_odd_scsi_dos_config">DOS CD Drive Configuration</h4>
      <p>
        DOS doesn't know what a CD drive is, normally. It needs extensions
        loaded into it to be able to access them. This is also true in the
        IBM-compatible DOS world, but the drivers are a little different,
        seemingly. This section will basically assume you're using a SCSI
        drive, but might mention alternatives for IDE drive users here and
        there.

      <p>
        <span id="pc9801_buying_wyatt_odd_scsi_nec_brand"><b>NEC Brand Drives</b></span><br/>
        If you are using an NEC brand SCSI optical drive and an NEC SCSI-1
        controller, you can probably use the <code>NECCDA.SYS</code> driver. If
        it's an NEC SCSI optical drive and an NEC SCSI-II controller, I think
        that means you need the <code>NECCDB.SYS</code> driver instead. There's
        also <code>NECCD.SYS</code> to try, as well as every other letter in
        the range of <code>NECCD[A-K].SYS</code> at least.
      </p>
      <p>
        Yeah, I know it's annoying. I can't find nice documentation to figure
        out which drives go with which drivers, but I know at least <b>some</b>
        of the drivers are for IDE drives. <b>I suspect most if not all of the
          NECCD[C-K] range are for various IDE variants.</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        Not all of those drivers come with NEC MS-DOS, even in version 6.2 (the
        last released version). In addition, the above only seems to matter if
        you are using an NEC branded SCSI drive; I wasn't able to get that
        driver to detect my drive (non-NEC) at all unless I spoofed an NEC
        vendor ID, and if I did that then the computer hung during
        initialization of the driver. But by most accounts, <b>if you are
        within the NEC ecosystem</b>, the above are the drivers to use.
        It may be possible that <i>some</i> other drives will also work with
        some of those drivers. I can't confirm this.

        If you aren't using an NEC brand drive/controller, it could be that
        trying to use the NEC drivers makes your system freeze.
      </p>
      <p>
        Mine <i>did</i> freeze; I suppose it could just be that the NEC driver
        is doing an "Epson Check" and intentionally sabotaging me for not using
        their hardware. If that is all it is, then there's supposed to be an
        Epson installer tool somewhere specifically made to patch out these
        "Epson Checks" in NEC software. But I didn't think of that until
        afterwards, so I looked for other, non-NEC solutions.
      </p>
      <p>
        I had to use a different driver to connect my SCSI CD drive, which
        I found on archive.org and in case anything ever happens to it.
        The driver in question is <code>CDSD.SYS</code>, which is under an open
        source license, from what I can tell. The source code seems to be
        available <a href="http://ysflight.in.coocan.jp/FM/towns/cdsd/CDSD_SRC.ZIP">here</a>
        - note that it also appears it can be built for FM Towns! There is also
        a version of the source code, which looks like it may be older, on
        <a href="https://www.vector.co.jp/soft/dos/hardware/se000298.html">Vector.jp</a>,
        which I have also used to find a floppy disk image converter in the
        past.

        <a href="http://akiyuki.boy.jp/old/t98next/midi/scsi4cd.zip">here,</a>
        seemingly from the author of the T98-Next emulator author, to make it

        If doing a fresh install, or maybe also if running NEC DOS, you can
        try to let the installer automatically configure your driver for you.
        It might work, even if your drive is not NEC. I can't guarantee
        anything.
      </p>
      <p>
        If it hangs after a reboot, though, you will need to use a DOS boot
        floppy disk to edit the hard drive's <code>AUTOEXEC.BAT</code> and
        <code>CONFIG.SYS</code> files to remove the offending lines (which
        will contain the phrase <code>CD_101</code> in every case I have seen
        so far). You can also just prefix those lines with <code>REM </code>
        (the space after <code>REM</code> is important), which is how you
        comment out lines in both <code>BAT</code> files and in
        <code>CONFIG.SYS</code>.
      </p>
      <p>
        If DOS is already installed and you want to add a drive, I think the
        correct step is probably to run the <code>CUSTOM</code> command, which
        seems to be NEC's tool for automatically managing
        <code>CONFIG.SYS</code> and <code>AUTOEXEC.BAT</code> for some typical
        use cases. I can't really help you with it, though, because I don't
        even know where to begin and I am more comfortable manually editing
        CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT anyway as far as CD drives are concerned.

        <span id="pc9801_buying_wyatt_odd_manual_add"><b>Manually Adding a Drive</b></span><br/>
        If you've never messed around much in DOS before (including western
        versions), some of this might be new to you. It's not too new to me,
        but that doesn't mean I love the process, either. Basically, though,
        here's the steps as I understand them. I hope I don't leave anything
        out.
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>Step 1</i>:<br/>
        Step one is getting the driver files. Some of them
        (<code>NECCDA.SYS</code>, <code>NECCDB.SYS</code>,
        <code>NECCDC.SYS</code>, <code>NECCDD.SYS</code>,
        and maybe(?) <code>NECCDCHK.SYS</code>) are included on the NEC
        MS-DOS 6.2 floppy disk set (on disk 1). They should be installed
        already, but if not, you can copy them off of the floppy disk.
        They will be named with <code>.SY_</code> extensions instead of
        <code>.SYS</code>, because <b>these are compressed files that need to
        be unpacked.</b> If they were installed already, they are already
        unpacked.
      </p>
      <p>
        To unpack a file like this, you need <code>EXPAND.EXE</code>, which is
        available in uncompressed form on NEC MS-DOS 6.2's disk 1 as well.
        If you booted from your hard drive and put the DOS installer disk in
        the first floppy drive afterwards, then your hard drive will be <code>A:</code>
        and your floppy disk will be in drive <code>B:</code> - this is
        different from the IBM PC, but important to note.
      </p>
      <p>Assuming that the above is true (you booted from your hard drive),
        the following should work to change your 'current directory' to the
        root of the B drive and unpack the file back to the hard disk.
      </p>
      <div class="codewrap">
        <pre class="block">B:
cd &yen;
expand NECCDA.SY_ A:&yen;DOS&yen;NECCDA.SYS</pre>
      </div>
      <p>
        If you don't have the <code>A:&yen;DOS</code> directory, then you can
        just output it to <code>A:&yen;NECCDA.SYS</code> instead.
      </p>
      <p>
        Also note, of course, that in Japanese DOS/Windows, the yen sign (&yen;)
        serves the same function as backslash (\), and is actually using the
        exact same character numeric representation internally. It's just
        that Japan's "code page" replaces \ with &yen;.
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>Step 2</i>:<br/>
        Step two is editing <code>CONFIG.SYS</code>.This is a special file in
        DOS that tells it about the drivers it should load at startup, and how
        it should load them. In other words, because we need to tell DOS about
        our CD driver, it must have a <code>CONFIG.SYS</code> entry.

      <p>
        Unfortunately, as far as I can recall, you can't load a CD driver
        without first loading some other drivers. I've provided my CONFIG.SYS
        file, in case it helps you to figure things out. A lot of it is
        irrelevant, but I think it depends on at least <code>HIMEM.SYS</code>
        and <code>EMM386.EXE</code> to work properly. You will have to adjust
        it to look in the right places, if your hard drive is organized
        differently from mine. I think mine is pretty standard in this
        instance, though.
      </p>
      <p>
        So here is my <code>CONFIG.SYS</code>:
      </p>
      <div class="codewrap">
        <pre class="block">FILES=30
BUFFERS=10
SHELL=&yen;COMMAND.COM /P

DEVICE=A:&yen;DOS&yen;HIMEM.SYS
DEVICE=A:&yen;DOS&yen;EMM386.EXE /UMB /P=64

DEVICE=A:&yen;DOS&yen;SETVER.EXE
DEVICEHIGH=A:&yen;DOS&yen;PRINT.SYS /U
DEVICE=A:&yen;LOGITEC&yen;FAST301.EXE
DEVICE=A:&yen;LOGITEC&yen;ASPILOG.SYS

DEVICE=A:&yen;DOS&yen;CDSD.SYS /D:CD_101 /I5

LASTDRIVE=Q
DOS=HIGH,UMB</pre>
      </div>
      <p>
        I believe the important bits there are the lines with
        <code>HIMEM.SYS</code>, <code>EMM386.EXE</code>, and
        <code>CDSD.SYS</code>. If they aren't already there, anything else in
        this example can probably be omitted. For instance, the
        <code>LOGITEC</code> things are for my specific SCSI controller,
        but I don't think you need to have a special driver loaded for your
        particular controller board. Just try them if you have problems
        (with your appropriate card's drivers, of course).
      </p>
      <p>
        The <code>/P=64</code> argument to <code>EMM386</code> can likely be
        omitted; EMM386 defaults to using all of the expanded memory area it
        can (rather than just 64 pages, like that is specifying). It was just
        automatically added by something or another and I haven't had a reason
        to change it yet. But the <b>important</b> arguments are the ones to
        <code>CDSD.SYS</code> - particularly, you need to know your optical
        drive's SCSI ID and feed it as an argument to <code>CDSD</code> or it
        will fail with a complaint about an invalid SCSI ID. It seems to be a
        somewhat common convention to make the drives with ID's 5 and 6 optical
        drives, so if you only have one or two optical drives <code>/I:5</code>
        makes sense. To add a drive 6, you'd simply add a second
        <code>CDSD.SYS</code> line... I think. If my understanding is correct,
        in that case you'd also need to name the driver (<code>/D:</code>)
        something else for a secondary optical drive; maybe CD_102. The
        name actually apparently does not matter, as long as it matches up with
        a line in <code>AUTOEXEC.BAT</code> (which we will get to next).
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>Step 3</i>:<br/>
        Finally, we need to edit <code>AUTOEXEC.BAT</code>. This is another
        special file that DOS looks for and reads at startup. The difference
        is that <code>AUTOEXEC.BAT</code> runs commands just like a user can at
        a command prompt manually; I don't <i>think</i> there's a way to
        manually load in drivers like <code>CONFIG.SYS</code> does.
      </p>
      <p>
        In our case, <code>AUTOEXEC.BAT</code> needs to run a program called
        <code>MSCDEX.EXE</code>, Microsoft's CD Extensions program. I suppose
        it's what DOS calls a TSR program (terminate-stay-resident), in that
        it loads its code into memory for other programs to hook into later
        when they need to access the CD drive. It's a sort of workaround for
        the lack of multitasking to make it so programmers don't have to have
        their own CD driver as part of their software's code. I guess you could
        also say it's like some horrible kind of shared library (like DLL's).
      </p>
      <p>
        Anyway - here's my AUTOEXEC.BAT.
      </p>
      <div class="codewrap">
        <pre class="block">PATH A:&yen;DOS;A:&yen;
SET TEMP=A:&yen;DOS
SET DOSDIR=A:&yen;DOS
A:&yen;DOS&yen;MSCDEX.EXE /D:CD_101 /L:Q
A:&yen;DOS&yen;SMARTDRV.EXE /X</pre>
      </div>
      <p>
        You can ignore the <code>SMARTDRV</code> line; it's for hard drive data
        caching, which speeds up disk drive use sometimes. I don't know if it
        does anything for CD speeds. <code>MSCDEX</code> is the only critical
        one, I believe.
      </p>
      <p>
        It seems to be another convention with the PC-98 for things to map the
        optical drive to drive letter Q. Weird, isn't it. I think I might get
        it though; if they are the farthest drive letters down the list that
        they can be, then adding another hard drive or floppy drive is less
        likely to mess up any scripts that might have been written assuming
        that drive 'D:' would be a floppy disk or something. Since the PC-98
        uses a proper Shugart interface instead of IBM's version of it, it
        can have four floppy drives, so this makes a little more sense. But
        if you want to change the drive letter from 'Q:' to something else,
        you change the <code>/L:Q</code> to
        <code>/L:(your-drive-letter)</code>.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Two SCSI Drives</b><br/>
        Here's how I would <b>guess</b> you would change it to use two CD
        drives with SCSI ID's 5 and 6, mapped to drive letters P and Q.
        This is only a guess.
      </p>

      <h3 id="pc9801_buying_wyatt_adapting_floppy_drives">Floppy Drives: to Use or Replace?</h3>
      <p>
        Planning on using real floppy disks? You'll need some good diskettes.
        These are no longer being made, so you'll have to buy new old stock (or
        used, if you feel very lucky) - unless you already have some of course.
      </p>
      <p>
        Older PC-98's use DD (double density) diskettes and drives, and the
        drives can't reliably write to 1.44MB HD floppy disks which have lower
        coercivity, and need stronger magnetism to flip a bit from a zero to a one
        or vice versa. So if yours is an older model (before around 1993 or
        1994), you almost certainly need DD diskettes.
      </p>
      <p>
        It may also be a good idea to invest in a cleaning kit, or perhaps find
        a way to clean the drives without one. It only takes one bad disk to
        mess up a floppy drive and make it need a cleaning to avoid ruining
        good disks.
      </p>
      <p>
        I wish it were easier to keep using real ones, because I do happen to
        like using them... when they work.

      <h3 id="pc9801_buying_wyatt_writing_floppies_linux">Writing Floppy Disks (Linux)</h3>
      <p>
        The key to writing floppies for a PC-98 in Linux is to use a program
        called "ufiformat." Especially if your PC-98 is not new enough to
        support 300 RPM 1.44MB disk reading/writing, it is absolutely
        essential.
      </p>
      <p>
        I wrote a script for me and my friend that handles the details of
        setting up a floppy disk for the PC-98 series. It depends on the
        following utilities (and perhaps more).
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          A bourne shell (any standard, non-<code>csh</code>-type Linux/Unix
          shell)
        </li>
        <li><code>ufiformat</code></li>
        <li><code>lsscsi</code></li>
        <li><code>awk</code></li>
        <li><code>sudo</code></li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The <code>sudo</code> calls can all be removed if you plan to invoke
        the script as root. So I don't actually consider <code>sudo</code> to
        be a hard dependency.

      <p>
        I have absolutely no clue how to format a floppy disk to 1.2MB at
        360RPM under any version of Windows. My one floppy disk imaging tool of
        choice doesn't work, because it assumes all floppies are 1.44MB.
        And I don't even know what the API call would be in software to
        communicate a mode change to the floppy drive in Windows. I guess
        Greaseweazle would work, since it lets you read and write to the disk
        with no interference from a floppy controller. But that's a hardware
        solution no other platform needs.

        I tried to help my friend to do it in Windows and came back empty every

      <h3>FlashFloppy/HxC</h3>
      <p>
        Planning on forgoing floppy drives? You'll need to get some floppy
        drive emulators. A lot of games require that you have disks in two drives
        at once, so just one probably won't work, until/unless the FlashFloppy
        firmware fork for emulating two drives with one Gotek comes together.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Gotek drives and FlashFloppy firmware (you can't use the stock Gotek
        firmware) have been discussed at length elsewhere on the web, so I will
        probably talk about what I had to do for my Epson but won't give general
        advice on how to get FlashFloppy onto a Gotek just now.
      </p>
      <h4>Where to put the drive emulators?</h4>
      <p>
        You want to just replace the original drives? Well, depending on your
        exact model, that might not be too easy. A lot of machines, both
        from Epson and from NEC itself, have floppy disk shaped slots moulded
        into the outer casing for a pre-set number of drives, and won't even
        accept other <i>real</i> floppy drives, if they have the eject button
        in a slightly different position. I consider this to be kind of a jerk
        way to do things, but it seems that it was quite common for companies
        to do this to make their drives integrate more smoothly/aesthetically
        into the casing.
      </p>
      <p>
        If your PC doesn't have nice open rectangular holes in the case, then
        even if you don't want to modify your casing, all hope might not be
        lost. Note that I have not done this yet - but many if not all PC-98's
        have an external floppy drive connector on the back of the system. It
        uses a variant of the so-called "centronics" connector. I believe it
        should be possible to modify your system to identify external drives as
        the first and second drive and to prefer those over the internal ones.
      </p>
      <p>
        Again, I haven't done this, but if the floppy drive 0 and 1 selection
        pins are exposed on the "centronics" connector, then you could simply
        disconnect the internal ones or flip some BIOS setting/DIP switch and
        be good to go. If those lines aren't exposed externally, you can simply
        hijack those lines from the internal floppy drives' ribbon cable and
        pass them out with a method of your choosing.
      </p>
      <p>
        I might elaborate on this if I need to, but for now I will assume you
        can figure out a floppy drive solution that works for you, and
        I will explain how I did mine (internally).
      </p>
      <h4 id="pc9801_buying_wyatt_adding_goteks">Adding Goteks internally on the Epson PC-486GR</h4>
      <p>
        I decided I was going to forego floppies. I just can't trust them
        anymore and I know I'm going to run out of good ones some day.
        Additionally, it could be that I just had the DIP switches configured
        wrong at the time and the floppy drives actually are just fine,
        but when I first got it, it wouldn't boot anything. I haven't tried
        the real drives since fixing the DIP switches. I think the last owner
        had them set up for external floppy drive booting.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Epson PC-486GR has two or three floppy drives internally, depending
        on your configuration from the factory. These drives are a little...
        quirky. But they do work and can be adapted to use Goteks instead.
      </p>
      <p>
        For starters, the Epson's 3.5" bays have brackets to fit them in a
        5.25" wide slot in the case, but <b>these slots are not as tall as a
        standard 5.25" bay slot</b>, so you can't just use a normal PC
        mounting bracket for attaching a floppy drive. I was unfortunate
        enough to have pre-emptively ordered two adapter brackets that I now
        cannot use. Anyone want them?&hellip;
      </p>
      <p>
        The <b>good</b> news is that the brackets that come in the Epson are
        able to mount a standard 3.5" floppy drive or Gotek just fine - with
        the caveat that you won't have a nice plastic bezel to cover up the
        gaps on the sides of the Gotek. That's why I have masking tape on the
        front of mine. When I'm not looking directly at it, it's fine! And it
        blocks a little of the noise from the blower fan on the 75 MHz 486 DX4
        that mine has been upgraded with by the previous owner inside.
      </p>
      <p>
        Yes; I know the sticker says 50MHz DX2. But there's some other kind of
        accelerator card - which the Japanese seem to call a
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geta_(footwear)">Geta</a> -
        inside of it that I am pretty sure is not an Epson product.
      </p>
      <p>
        I am guessing they are called "geta" because of the way that the CPU
        sort of sits on a PCB with pins (like the vertical boards on the shoes)
        underneath that sort of look like stilts. This board is required
        because the 486 DX4 runs at 3.3 volts rather than the 5 volts of the
        original 486 SX/DX and DX2, thus needing a voltage converter between
        it and the PC itself.
      </p>
      <p>
        An additional oddity is that the Epson uses laptop-style 26 pin floppy
        disk drives that connect via flat flex cable, attached to an adapter
        board that converts them to use full-sized 5.25" drive card edge
        connectors and large 4-pin "molex" power connectors.

        Since I don't want or need that adapter board anymore, I need to find

        backs of the drive brackets. This means "Molex" to "Berg" power
        adapters, as well as IDC to card edge floppy adapters, <i>plus</i> some
        homemade extension boards to bridge the remaining distance from the IDC
        connector to where the ribbon cable connects at the rears of the

        Do note, however, that in the final installation there is more

        the perfboard from contacting the metal above it.

        It's been bulletproof since installation, honestly. I probably wouldn't
        make the extension boards exactly like that again, but I don't regret
        doing it this way this time.

        figured out why that is, nor how the original drives sidestepped the

        Just because I feel like trying to be helpful, I'll share an adapter
        board that I designed afterwards which I <i>think</i> will work fine.
        I don't recommend making the spacers by hand like I did; it took a lot
        of time and I probably inhaled a lot of leaded solder fumes. It also
        required two extra connectors. I have never had any of my board designs
        actually get printed, however, so I apologise in advance if there are
        any issues. Please get in touch.

        Known Problem Models
      </h3>
      <p>
        For the PC-9801/PC-9821 series computers, I mainly have heard of
        problems with the "A-MATE" series, which I believe consists of the
        following models:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>PC-9821Ae</li>
        <li>PC-9821Ap</li>
        <li>PC-9821Ap2</li>
        <li>PC-9821As</li>
        <li>PC-9821As2</li>
        <li>PC-9821As3</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        With98 (see <a href="#pc9801_buying_wyatt_links_japanese">links</a>)
        doesn't seem to consider the following to be "A-MATE" series machines.
        I am assuming that is because the following machines have window
        accelerators built-in and are therefore sort of "post-apocalyptic" as
        far as DOS goes.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>PC-9821Ap3</li>
        <li>PC-9821Af</li>
        <li>PC-9821An</li>
        <li>PC-9821</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The problems mainly seem to be capacitors going bad, primarily in the
        power supplies. I get the impression that they may also have problems
        with early surface mount capacitors going bad, since people often speak
        of them in the same sentence as they talk about later-model Sharp
        X68000 computers (which I believe also had motherboard capacitor
        issues).
      </p>
      <p>
        In general, it's a good idea to replace capacitors in all old
        electronics one gets, but I don't really follow my own advice.
        Capacitor failures might just cause a problem that can be fixed by
        replacing the capacitor, but they can also cause cascading failures
        where more stuff fails, either immediately or after a short delay
        (if the cap isn't immediately replaced). Even if the device appears to
        continue working, if you hear a POP coming from your electronics, don't
        ignore it.

        Capacitors
      </h3>
      <p>
        I bought a PC-9801-86 sound card that was covered in capacitor leakage
        and didn't work properly when plugged in. Be cautious, especially when
        surface mount type capacitors are involved. They are hard to desolder
        safely with an iron (without ripping up traces/solder pads), and early
        ones <b>love</b> to die. Upon desoldering, they will smell strangely
        like fish. A hot air station is recommended (to maximize the smell of
        fish).
      </p>
      <p>
        As far as I can tell, both my Epson and my friend's PC-9821 Ce2's/Cs2's
        are using only through-hole capacitors on their mainboards - so you
        should be safe-ish with those. But it's still always a good idea to
        replace old capacitors, even if I don't practice what I preach.
      </p>
      <p>
        Additionally, the PC-9821 A* series computers seem to have problematic
        capacitors in their power supplies rather frequently. I would suggest
        replacing all capcitors in those, if you go for one of them. Or find a
        PSU that was already recapped (probably expensive).

        There has been some attempt made to sort these by significance,

        first few in each language section as as required reading when
        figuring out how you want to have your PC configured/what parts

      <p>This site contains a comprehensive list of most if not all PC-98
        models (including Epson clones) released in Japan. It also contains
        system specifications, information on model variants (information like
        how the PC-486GR<b>2</b> came with no hard drive, or what OS a
        computer came installed with). It will also tell you information like
        how much RAM the computer can be upgraded to use, how much RAM it
        shipped with, the release date, and oftentimes even the dimensions of
        the case and weight (which is handy to know for purposes of estimating
        shipping costs).
      </p>
      <p>
        It is also useful for checking if a PC-98 model you are thinking of
        buying contains undesirable chips on the circuit board, like a Windows

        I'd say that if I had to pick one site to find technical details of

        details that would be useful if writing an assembly program for the
        PC-98, as well as details that would be useful if you were to try to
        write an OS.

        chance they have other posts, too.
      </p>
      <p>
        This person's blog post helped me to understand how to make a floppy
        disk work on a PC-98. Even if you are just preparing western
        IBM-formatted floppy disks so that your PC-98 can read and write them,
        or are trying to copy files to the PC-98, it's good information to
        know.
      </p>
      <p>
        In brief, some 3.5" floppy drives can run at 360 RPM - many USB ones,
        but not as many internal western ones, if any. The PC-98 traditionally
        used 360 RPM, even for 3.5" disks. In this mode of operation, a 3.5"
        diskette is accessed exactly like a 5.25" diskette, as far as the drive
        or computer is concerned. But for this to work, your floppy must first
        be <i>sectored and formatted</i> as if it were a 5.25" disk. Most
        western 3.5" floppy disks will not be from the factory - they'll be
        IBM formatted, which for high density floppies means 300 RPMs and
        1.44 megabytes of data instead of 360 RPMs and 1.2 megabytes. If your
        drive and software supports it, you can transform an IBM formatted
        floppy into a PC98 formatted one. Also, some later PC-9821's (perhaps
        1993 or 1994 onwards) can natively handle 300 RPM 1.44 megabyte
        diskettes in addition to their historical 360RPM DD and HD formats.

        some earlier versions of NEC MS-DOS do).

        Can't find what you're looking for above? Here's some words that might
        be handy to put into search engines. For the "how to type" row,
        I am using the "romaji typing method" in Anthy on Linux, but I think
        it should work similarly on Windows with Microsoft's input method
        editor. Also, the spaces in the "how to type" field are merely there
        to aid in mapping the keystrokes to the individual japanese
        characters. If kanji are involved, you will need to press 'space'
        after inputting that group of characters and select your kanji.
      </p>

        This maybe wouldn't be necessary if typing the hepburn pronunciation
        worked. But 'small kana' and such have to be entered differently.

        A '&#8251;' character (Japanese reference mark) means I was too
        ignorant and/or lazy to figure out how to type something. Sorry in
        advance. In such cases, if a typing guide is still provided, it means
        that it was my best attempt and it came close or sort of worked but
        added extra junk characters.
      </p>

        I just include it in the hopes that it may help someone who is trying
        to learn Japanese - even if many or all of the words here are just
        katakana transliterations of English.

        This list is by no means comprehensive. It just contains some useful
        phrases/terms off the top of my head that I searched for while getting
        parts. A lot of things can be searched without this, like "HDD"
        (Hard Disk Drive), "FDD" (Floppy Disk Drive), and
