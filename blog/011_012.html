      <h2>Lost in Translation:<br/>
        The Hidden World of Old Japanese Domestic Computers
      </h2>
      <p><i>10 Jan 2023</i> [<a class="permalink" href="./011_012.html#pc9801-1">Permanent link</a>]<br/>
        A good friend of mine with a passion for pixel art has long had a
        fascination with old Japanese domestic computers, especially the NEC
        PC-9801 series.
      </p>
      <p>
        I've always been more of a Sharp X68000 man, myself. Not because
        there's anything <i>wrong</i> with the 98, though!&em; the X68000 is
        just a much more powerful computer if you are interested in playing
        games, with much stronger graphical capabilities in most respects than
        its competition.
      </p>
      <p>
        Unfortunately, the X68000 has a few problems if you're looking to
        obtain one in 2023:
      </p>
      <p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            It was only ever sold in Japan (obviously).
          </li>
          <li>
            It needs a 24KHz horizontal scan rate monitor, which almost
            nothing in the US does (even VGA flat screens).</li>
          <li>
            A lot of them have bad surface mount capacitors that leak
            out and destroy their circuitry. This is especially apparent with
            the later, more-powerful ones. Pretty much the same problem all
            Sega Game Gears seem to have.</li>
          <li>
            Almost all documentation is in Japanese... I am trying to learn
            Japanese, but it's like being thrown in the ocean to learn to swim.
          </li>
          <li>
            A lot of the documentation isn't scanned. I'm guessing this is
            some sort of fear about copyright law and the way it is enforced
            in Japan?
          </li>
          <li>
            It was always the underdog computer in the market, and never sold
            as well as its competitors. It also has a fiercely loyal fan-base
            today. Prices are sky-high (perhaps in part because no one is
            satisfied with just one X68000 and they need to have <i>at least
            one</i> of every model).
          </li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p>
        &hellip;Hey, wait a moment. Haven't I seen this somewhere before?
      </p>
      <div class="imgcontain imgwrap" id="a4000_prices">
        <a href="pc9801_1/full/a4000_prices.png">
          <img src="pc9801_1/a4000_prices.png"
               alt="Amiga 4000 prices on ebay, $3000 plus."/>
        </a>
        <div class="imgwrap caption imgcentercaption">
          Pretty much the same thing, but with an additional language barrier.
        </div>
      </div>
      <p>
        So basically, much like with Amigas, the continual interest in the
        platform from people with more money than I have has ensured that I've
        written off being able to afford and justify getting an X68000 in the
        near future, barring incredible luck. But I'm still interested in
        Japanese computers; there are a lot of weird designs out there that are
        intriguing to me, and some of them look absolutely <i>gorgeous</i>.
      </p>
      <div class="imgcontain imgwrap" id="sharp_x1">
        <a href="pc9801_1/full/sharp_x1.jpg">
          <img src="pc9801_1/sharp_x1.jpg"
               alt="The Sharp X1 computer looks beautiful in red and black."/>
        </a>
        <div class="imgwrap caption imgcentercaption">
          The Sharp X1. I wish some of my computers looked this good!
        </div>
      </div>
      <p>
        I briefly considered an X1, which looks stunning, and would also be
        able to run CP/M. But unfortunately (again), there's not much I think I
        would actually <i>do</i> on one, no matter how beautiful it would look
        on my desk. Maybe if I can find a good thing to do on it some day, I'll
        return to thinking about it. The monitor would be pricey, I bet, but
        the X1 computer itself regularly shows up for pretty fair prices
        online, even in red (the objective best color for it).
      </p>
      <p>
        So, basically, I'd been considering getting into Japanese computers for
        some time, but never following through. Even ignoring the initial cost
        at auction, the shipping fees would be murder on top of that... and
        there are all sorts of other considerations that I'd have to make when
        buying one, as well, to actually be able to use it here. For instance,
        what kinds of floppies will they use? Do I want to use real floppies,
        or Gotek-style floppy drive hardware emulators and disk images? How
        will i connect a hard drive? How do I actually <i>power</i> the thing?
        What kind of software can I practically use on it? What kind of screen
        do I need?
      </p>
      <p>
        As you might be able to see, it quickly becomes a logistical nightmare
        and a money pit. I'd experienced some of this with my Amiga 500, but
        was lucky enough to get mine with a correct monitor and hard drive and
        power supplies included in the sale at a really nice price, locally,
        with no shipping fees. But I'd still felt the need to upgrade to a newer
        hard drive and caused endless SCSI headaches in the process. I'd
        upgraded the RAM, added a Genlock to subtitle laserdiscs, put in an ECS
        (enhanced) version of its "Denise" chip to enable higher resolutions,
        added a Kickstart (bootloader ROM) switcher to let me boot newer
        versions of Amiga Workbench (the OS), and all sorts of other things to
        better use it. All of that stuff adds up fast! And to do the same on
        a Japanese computer, many of those purchases would include paying
        shipping fees from about halfway across the planet whenever I ran into
        a new problem that needed a hardware solution.
      </p>
      <p>
        So, knowing all of this would happen, why did I decide to follow
        through, eventually?
      </p>
      <p>
        Well, basically, it was because of my aforementioned good friend with
        the pixel art passion.
      </p>
      <p>
        This friend had long been enamored specifically with the NEC PC-9801
        and its descendants. To be completely honest, the PC-98 has some games
        with good artwork and stuff, but it was the least interesting of the
        major Japanese platforms to me. It was the one that sold the best, and
        it wasn't <i>particularly</i> speedy or performant. It also used x86
        CPU's, which means it was the most "IBM-Like" of the big platforms,
        alongside Fujitsu's "FM Towns" line. But the FM Towns had more
        interesting graphical capabilities for playing games. The main draw for
        the PC98, for people interested in games, seems to be one of three
        things these days:
        <ol>
          <li>
            Touhou, a "bullet hell" type shooter game series featuring cutesy
            manga/anime style girl characters which started on the PC-98
            platform. I'd say that (at least from what people <i>say</i> online
            and the frequency with which they say it) this one franchise
            accounts for maybe 40% of the gaming interest in the platform,
            both inside and outside of Japan. The Touhou franchise is still
            ongoing, so that's probably a large part of why it has stayed
            popular while everything else is forgotten.
          </li>
          <li>
            Early PC98-era computer games, aimed at a general audience. Later
            in the system's lifetime, most people interested in computer games
            moved to other platforms. This means either to game consoles like
            the Famicom, Super Famicom, Mega Drive, and so on, or to other
            computer platforms like the aforementioned X68000 (which had some
            <i>excellent</i> arcade ports) or the FM Towns. Some games in this
            category of early general audience games for PC-98 include some
            great RPG's you may or may not have heard of, such as:
            <ul>
              <li>Falcom's <i>Ys</i> franchise, which survives to this day</li>
              <li>Glodia's <i>Emerald Dragon</i>, which has a translation on the
                SNES version&hellip; but I like the art on the PC98 version the
                most.</li>
            </ul>
            I'd say that this interest accounts for maybe 5% of the
            outside-of-Japan interest in the system, and I'd guess maybe 15-25%
            of the interest <i>within</i> Japan.
          </li>
          <li>
            Finally, I can't just dance around it forever, so it's best to just
            address it here. later in the system's lifetime it became a staple
            for erotic games (abbreviated as <i>eroge</i>). It was very well
            suited to this, since even though its actual performance at
            animating things on the screen was rather poor, it could display
            somewhat high resolution static graphics in a fair number of
            colors. So it was ideal for visual novels.
          </li>
        </ol>
      </p>
      <p>
        To be honest, the <i>eroge</i> element probably is what interests me
        the <i>least</i> of the above about the 98.
      </p>
      <p>
        Additionally, there may be some more interest if someone wants to run
        Linux or similar on it, since buying a domestic 486 PC is not
        significantly less expensive anymore.
