      <h2>Lost in Translation:<br/>
        The Hidden World of Old Japanese Domestic Computers
      </h2>
      <p><i>10 Jan 2023</i> [<a class="permalink" href="./011_012.html#pc9801-1">Permanent link</a>]<br/>
        A good friend of mine with a passion for pixel art has long had a
        fascination with old Japanese domestic computers, especially the NEC
        PC-9801 series.
      </p>
      <p>
        I've always been more of a Sharp X68000 man, myself. Not because
        there's anything <i>wrong</i> with the 98, though!&ndash; the X68000 is
        just a much more powerful computer if you are interested in playing
        games, with much stronger graphical capabilities in most respects than
        its competition.
      </p>
      <p>
        Unfortunately, the X68000 has a few problems if you're looking to
        obtain one in 2023:
      </p>
      <p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            It was only ever sold in Japan (obviously).
          </li>
          <li>
            It needs a 24KHz horizontal scan rate monitor, which almost
            nothing in the US does (even VGA flat screens).</li>
          <li>
            A lot of them have bad surface mount capacitors that leak
            out and destroy their circuitry. This is especially apparent with
            the later, more-powerful ones. Pretty much the same problem all
            Sega Game Gears seem to have.</li>
          <li>
            Almost all documentation is in Japanese&hellip; I am trying to learn
            Japanese, but it's like being thrown in the ocean to learn to swim.
          </li>
          <li>
            A lot of the documentation isn't scanned. I'm guessing this is
            some sort of fear about copyright law and the way it is enforced
            in Japan?
          </li>
          <li>
            It was always the underdog computer in the market, and never sold
            as well as its competitors. It also has a fiercely loyal fan-base
            today. Prices are sky-high (perhaps in part because no one is
            satisfied with just one X68000 and they need to have <i>at least
            one</i> of every model).
          </li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p>
        &hellip;Hey, wait a moment. Haven't I seen this somewhere before?
      </p>
      <div class="imgcontain imgwrap" id="a4000_prices">
        <a href="pc9801_1/full/a4000_prices.png">
          <img src="pc9801_1/a4000_prices.png"
               alt="Amiga 4000 prices on ebay, $3000 plus."/>
        </a>
        <div class="imgwrap caption imgcentercaption">
          The X68000 seems to be pretty much analogous to what the Amiga became here.
        </div>
      </div>
      <p>
        So basically, much like with Amigas, the continual interest in the
        platform from people with more money than I have has ensured that I've
        written off being able to afford and justify getting an X68000 in the
        near future, barring incredible luck. But I'm still interested in
        Japanese computers; there are a lot of weird designs out there that are
        intriguing to me, and some of them look absolutely <i>gorgeous</i>.
      </p>

        <div class="imgwrap caption imgcentercaption">
          The Sharp X1. I wish any of my computers looked this good!
        </div>
      </div>
      <p>
        I briefly had considered an X1, which looks stunning, and would also be
        able to run CP/M. But unfortunately (again), there's not much I think I
        would actually <i>do</i> on one, no matter how beautiful it would look
        on my desk. Maybe if I can find a good thing to do on it some day, I'll
        return to thinking about it. The monitor would be pricey, I bet, but
        the X1 computer itself regularly shows up for pretty fair prices
        online, even in red (the objective best color for it).
      </p>
      <h4>Some Reasons NOT to Buy a Japanese Computer</h4>
      <p>
        So, basically, I'd been considering getting into Japanese computers for
        some time, but never following through. Even ignoring the initial cost
        at auction, the shipping fees would be murder on top of that&hellip; and
        there are all sorts of other considerations that I'd have to make when
        buying one, as well, to actually be able to use it here. For instance,
        what kinds of floppies will they use? Do I want to use real floppies,
        or Gotek-style floppy drive hardware emulators and disk images? How
        will i connect a hard drive? How do I actually <i>power</i> the thing?
        What kind of software can I practically use on it? What kind of screen
        do I need?
      </p>
      <p>
        As you might be able to see, it quickly becomes a logistical nightmare
        and a money pit. I'd experienced some of this with my Amiga 500, but
        was lucky enough to get mine with a correct monitor and hard drive and
        power supplies included in the sale at a really nice price, locally,
        with no shipping fees. But I'd still felt the need to upgrade to a newer
        hard drive and caused endless SCSI headaches in the process. I'd
        upgraded the RAM, added a Genlock to subtitle laserdiscs, put in an ECS
        (enhanced) version of its "Denise" chip to enable higher resolutions,
        added a Kickstart (bootloader ROM) switcher to let me boot newer
        versions of Amiga Workbench (the OS), and all sorts of other things to
        better use it. All of that stuff adds up fast! And to do the same on
        a Japanese computer, many of those purchases would include paying
        shipping fees from about halfway across the planet whenever I ran into
        a new problem that needed a hardware solution.
      </p>
      <h4>Why I Still Ended Up Getting a Japanese Computer Anyway</h4>
      <p>
        So, knowing all of this would happen, and that it'd be a massive money
        pit, why did I decide to follow through, eventually?
      </p>
      <p>
        Well, basically, it was because of my aforementioned good friend with
        the pixel art passion.
      </p>
      <p>
        This friend had long been enamored specifically with the NEC PC-9801
        and its descendants. To be completely honest, the PC-98 has some games
        with good artwork and stuff, but it was the least interesting of the
        major Japanese platforms to me. It was the one that sold the best, and
        it wasn't <i>particularly</i> speedy or performant. It also used x86
        CPU's, which means it was the most "IBM-Like" of the big platforms,
        alongside Fujitsu's "FM Towns" line. But the FM Towns had more
        interesting graphical capabilities for playing games. The main draw for
        the PC98, for people interested in games, seems to be one of three
        things these days:
        <ol>
          <li>
            Touhou, a "bullet hell" type shooter game series featuring cutesy
            manga/anime style girl characters which started on the PC-98
            platform. I'd say that (at least from what people <i>say</i> online
            and the frequency with which they say it) this one franchise
            accounts for maybe 40% of the gaming interest in the platform,
            both inside and outside of Japan. The Touhou franchise is still
            ongoing, so that's probably a large part of why it has stayed
            popular while everything else is forgotten.
          </li>
          <li>
            Early PC98-era computer games, aimed at a general audience. Later
            in the system's lifetime, most people interested in computer games
            moved to other platforms. This means either to game consoles like
            the Famicom, Super Famicom, Mega Drive, and so on, or to other
            computer platforms like the aforementioned X68000 (which had some
            <i>excellent</i> arcade ports) or the FM Towns. Some games in this
            category of early general audience games for PC-98 include some
            great RPG's you may or may not have heard of, such as:
            <ul>
              <li>Falcom's <i>Ys</i> franchise, which survives to this day</li>
              <li>Glodia's <i>Emerald Dragon</i>, which has a translation on the
                SNES version&hellip; but I like the art on the PC98 version the
                most.</li>
            </ul>
            I'd say that this interest accounts for maybe 5% of the
            outside-of-Japan interest in the system, and I'd guess maybe 15-25%
            of the interest <i>within</i> Japan.
          </li>
          <li>
            Finally, I can't just dance around it forever, so it's best to just
            address it here. Later in the system's lifetime it became a staple
            for erotic games (abbreviated as <i>eroge</i>). It was very well
            suited to this, since even though its actual performance at
            animating things on the screen was rather poor, it could display
            somewhat high resolution static graphics in a fair number of
            colors. So it was ideal for visual novels. I'd guess that
            internationally this is 60% of the interest and in Japan it's about
            35% of the interest.
          </li>
        </ol>
      </p>
      <p>
        Additionally, there may be some more interest if someone wants to run
        Linux or similar on it, since buying a domestic 486 PC is not
        significantly less expensive anymore.
      </p>
      <p>
        To be honest, the <i>eroge</i> element probably is what interests me
        the <i>least</i> of the above about the 98; I am interested most in the
        computer RPG's that we never got here, both as a way to learn some
        Japanese and because I enjoy the art styles. I played a small portion
        of the English translation of the SNES version of 'Emerald Dragon,' and
        it looks like it might be really, really good storywise. I also have
        played an emulated version of 'Ys' and I <i>loved</i> the soundtrack
        (which was composed by Yuzo Koshiro, who later did the music for
        <i>Streets of Rage</i> and is often considered a master of frequency
        modulation synthesis music).
      </p>
      <p>
        But the other reason i was interested now was because of my friend, who
        has less technical background than I do but who has strong interest in
        learning. She has wanted a PC98 for a long time, and asked for my help
        in figuring out what to get and how to set it up. I decided it might be
        fun for me to get one, too, so we could figure stuff out together - and
        those are the mental gymnastics I did to get into a buying mood. It
        also is a somewhat smaller investment than an X68000, and with a LOT
        more supply available for sale.
      </p>
      <p>
        I've had a <i>lot</i> of fun teaching my friend and watching her gain
        more confidence with electronics. It seems to have been something she
        had wanted to get into for some time, but didn't know where to begin.
        Having been there myself, I suppose I took some sympathy&ndash; and my
        desire to share what I've learned with others also kicked in. Not to
        mention my own shelved curiosity about these platforms. It simply felt
        like it might be the right time.
      </p>
      <p>
        We had talked a lot about older computers in the past, and I expressed
        that I was somewhat familiar with the Japanese computer platforms, at
        least in theory. And it seemed like a fun thing that we could do
        together. So far, it actually has been, although there have been a few
        bumps in the road. I'll hopefully get around to explaining what that
        means exactly soon. At any rate, I had to start researching the PC-9801
        series in more depth to prepare for our respective purchases.
      </p>
      <h3 id="">The PC-9801 is NOT an IBM Clone</h3>
      <p>
        If you came here looking for info on the PC98 series, and aren't just
        casually reading my blog, then you should already know this&ndash; but
        the NEC PC-9801 and its descendants are <i>not</i> just fancier IBM
        PC's. They <i>do</i> have some similarities, on account of their
        chipsets, but if you want to run programs written for an IBM that
        does <b>ANY</b> BIOS calls or direct hardware access, you can expect
        that it might not run on a PC98. If it only uses MS-DOS/PC-DOS API's,
        though, then you might be fine.
      </p>
      <p>
        Basically, <b>don't just expect that you can install your American copy
        of MS-DOS on a PC98 and have it work. It will <i>not</i> work. You will
        have to be able to figure out how to read Japanese; this is unavoidable.
        </b>
      </p>
      <p>
        Here are some of the differences that I have encountered so far, in
        list form:
        <ul>
          <li>Incompatible keyboard protocol and connector - No equivalents outside of Japan
            <ul>
              <li>
                You will need an NEC keyboard or one made by Epson.
              </li>
              <li>
                I will specify more about the Epson option later on.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            Incompatible with PS/2 mouse protocol and connector; uses one of
            the following:
            <ul>
              <li>
                Microsoft "InPort" 9 pin mini-DIN bus mouse (later models)
              </li>
              <li>
                An electrically identical mouse with a 9-pin D-sub (earlier
                models)
              </li>
              <li>
                Passive adapters can be used to convert an inPort mouse to a
                D-Sub connector or vice versa.
              </li>
              <li>
                Quadrature mouses from other computers (Amiga, AT&amp;T 6300,
                and Atari ST, for instance) can be used, but must first be
                re-wired. A pre-ADB Macintosh mouse could be adapted, except
                that you'd be not have a right click button&ndash; which you will
                probably need.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            Incompatible RGB Video Output, both physically and electronically:
            <ul>
              <li>
                Runs at 640x400. 56Hz vertical refresh rate, 24KHz horizontal.
              </li>
              <li>
                Most american market CRT's and even LCD's won't display a
                stable picture with that video mode. Some CRT's may even be
                damaged by attempting to display it.
              </li>
              <li>
                Uses a DA15 connector for analogue RGB out (but does not use
                the same pinout as the old Macs).
              </li>
              <li>
                Some appear to also offer digital RGB out, but I assume this is
                at the same refresh rates as the analogue output. I doubt that
                EGA monitors (350 lines max, ~21KHz) would sync up properly.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>No ISA bus (uses "C-Bus")</li>
          <li>Completely different BIOS interface/boot process</li>
          <li>Different partition table on hard drives</li>
          <li>
            Floppy drive interface is different
            <ul>
              <li>
                Does not use the cable "twist" like IBM compatibles do
              </li>
              <li>
                <i>Almost</i> a standard Shugart interface (adds/moves density pin, READY pin)
              </li>
              <li>
                Drives must be jumpered to set a "drive ID" (due to lack of cable twist)
              </li>
              <li>
                Up to <b>four</b> floppy drives may be connected at once (instead of two)
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            The floppy drives themselves are a little different
            <ul>
              <li>
                Some later ones (about 1993 onward?) support high-density floppies, versus 1987 for IBM PC's
              </li>
              <li>
                Spins 3.5" disks at 360RPM instead of 300RPM to match sector layout and capacity of 5.25" disks.
              </li>
            </ul>

      <p>
        So, ya really want to learn about the PC-9801, do ya? Well, first, what
        do you want to do with yours? - depending on your answers to the below
        questions, some models may be preferable over others.
      </p>
      <h4>DOS, Windows, or Other?</h4>
      <p>
        If you intend to get a PC98 and run Windows programs on it, you can
        basically treat it as an IBM-compatible PC running that version of
        windows, except with a Japanese locale. I see little reason to do this,
        unless you really want a 486 running Windows but don't like the prices
        on IBM-compatible 486'es.
      </p>
      <p>
        It has also been said by many that the '98 series lost its "98-ness" in
        the mid 90's with the rise of Windows, as the computers moved away from
        the old µPD7220-derived design to using third-party GPU's that were
        more adept at accelerating 2D window management operations. These
        graphics chips were things made by companies like S3, and stripped away
        another bit of uniqueness from the series. Later models also introduced
        features like PCI card slots. The PC98 series rapidly moved towards
        being just a "Windows PC," compatible with win16/win32 programs made
        for IBM-compatible Wintel machines. DOS compatibility still existed to
        an extent, but the further away NEC moved, the more stuff began to
        break in DOS-land, where direct hardware access was still king.
      </p>
      <p>
        Thus, it seems that the PC-98 might have been one of the last
        non-IBM-compatible, non-Apple consumer personal computer series to
        survive in any form. But if you want to run Windows, why not just run
        Windows on an IBM-compatible...?
      </p>
      <p>
        In my personal opinion, the real reasons one should want a PC-9801 are
        some combination of game software, potentially learning Japanese, and
        maybe running free operating systems like the BSD's or Linux distros.
        There is very little attractive about the machines for plain old
        Windows use. In my case I keep a Gateway E-3200 (Pentium 3) around for
        my old Windows software use. It runs US English Windows 98 and Japanese
        Windows 2000, and packs a Voodoo3 GPU; this puts me in a good spot for
        anything I might really want to play in the Windows world, since I'm
        not really too interested in modern Windows games.
      </p>
      <h4>You Have Selected: DOS</h4>
      <p>
        I will just assume you can take a hint and realized that above I was
        essentially saying that DOS is the only real choice here for games, if
        you don't want your computer to be "just another old Windows PC."
      </p>
      <p>
        The rest of this article will probably not focus on Windows much, if at
        all.
      </p>
      <h3 id="pc9801_what_are_my_options">What are My Options for Hardware, then?</h3>
      <p>
        I stumbled my way into my choice based on a combination of factors.
        First of all, as mentioned above, I wanted it to be viable for DOS
        games. I also wanted it to be new enough to be able to run the same
        things my friend was running, which are largely from the era where the
        games don't look quite "8-bit" anymore and the pixel art can be more
        intricate. I also wanted it to be capable of FM sound (Yamaha YM2203 or
        YM2608). These chips have a lot in common with the YM2612 chip used in
        the Sega Mega Drive/Genesis consoles. I also desired expandability,
        the ability to use a hard drive, and to be honest I sort of wanted
        to do something no one else was doing.
      </p>
      <p>
        So, if you want a PC-98 for DOS, and you don't want to buy one for
        early games and another for late games, I'd say a 486 or 386 is the
        ideal range to choose from. Circa perhaps 1990 to 1994. You can find a
        list of a whole bunch of machines
        <a href="https://pc-9800.net/">on this site</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        First, I helped my friend to choose something. She already kind of
        knew what she wanted, so all I really had to do was cross reference
        the models she talked about with the ones on that site to check for
        red flags.
      </p>
      <h4>PC-9801 or PC-9821?</h4>
      <p>
        The PC-9801 was the original series of computers. The best way to
        describe the differences might just be to show how the PC-9801 and
        PC-9821 lines tended to differ.
      </p>
      <h4>9821:</h4>
      <p>
        The PC-9821 models came out targetted at use by Windows users, and have
        some quality of life improvements. For instance, to change settings on a
        PC-9801, you flip a bunch of DIP switches and need to have documentation
        to discover what they do (they are not necessarily marked on the board).
        But with the 9821, by holding the 'HELP' key while booting, you can
        enter a software configurator which shows you virtual dip switches that
        you can flip, with inline help text describing what each switch is
        doing. It can be a real time saver.
      </p>
      <p>
        The 9821 line also has 3.5" floppy disk drives; from what I can gather,
        the 9801 series usually had 5.25" and the 9821 usually had 3.5". Since
        3.5" floppies are a LOT easier to come by in good shape, and just
        generally age a little better, that may be one reason to consider using
        a PC-9821 if you intend to keep the original floppy drives.
      </p>
      <p>
        A 9821 is also much more likely to come with an IDE hard disk drive,
        or at least with a controller and connector for one. Typically, with
        a 9801, you need to use a SCSI controller and SCSI drives to get large
        storage capabilities. I personally struggle to make SCSI do what I want
        sometimes, so that might be another argument for using a 9821.
      </p>
      <h4>9801:</h4>
      <p>
        On the other hand, the 9801's were intended to be DOS machines; it may
        be easier to find a low-powered one, and it will <i>definitely</i> be
        easier to find one without a window accelerator GPU built-in. They seem
        to be generally less desirable than the early 9821's. Also, this is
        just something I have heard, but people say it's harder to open up the
        earlier 9801's (although later ones are probably pretty okay).
      </p>
      <h3>Yeah, But What Does All of That Mean?</h3>
      <p>
        I threw around a lot of terms describing the differences between the
        9801 and 9821. To elaborate a little, here's some more detailed
        explanations of what you should try to look for or avoid.
      </p>
      <h4>Red Flag #1: Integrated window accelerator graphics chip</h4>
      <p>
        Onboard window accelerator cards are for making Windows run with nice
        effects, like showing the contents of windows while dragging them
        around. Unfortunately, these machines force you to use that graphics
        chipset; there's no way to just "unplug" it and go back to using
        the old µPD7220 derivatives. So my friend needed to rule out
        <i>most</i> of the PC-9821 line. <b>But</b>, some of the early ones
        still had either no GPU card built in, or else simply had an
        accelerator card pre-installed that could easily be popped out.
      </p>
      <h4>Red Flag #2: No FM sound</h4>
      <p>
        Some later systems omitted the FM sound, especially laptop PC98
        models. We didn't look at the laptop models in much detail, though,
        since my friend very clearly expressed that she wanted a desktop model.
        Early models lacking FM sound are far too old to be able to play any
        but the oldest PC-98 DOS games at a decent speed.
      </p>
      <p>
        There are two main kinds of FM sound chips to consider; the "26-Sound"
        and "86-Sound." If your system has 26-sound, it's much better than
        nothing, but be forewarned that you might still end up springing for a
        PC-9801-86 sound card board if you want stereo sound, PCM audio
        playback, or Atari-style joystick compatibility. And that card on its
        own seems to cost upwards of $100 USD. So factor that in when ordering.
      </p>
      <p>
        Some 9821's (most, if not all, actually) have the "86 Sound" (YM2608)
        built-in. On these systems, you can connect a joystick to the system
        via an adapter that plugs into the keyboard port. I might add a
        diagram for this at some point, but basically you need to ground
        one or two wires and then hook the remaining pins up to the joystick
        inputs. People on yahoo auctions will sell you pre-made adapter cables.
      </p>
      <h4>Red Flag #3: No CD Drive</h4>
      <p>
        This isn't an instant "NEVER buy this" or anything, but if you don't
        have a CD drive built in, you may have to add one via a SCSI
        controller card. So be sure to factor in that additional cost, if
        having a CD drive actually matters to you.
      </p>
      <h4>Red Flag #4: Leaking Real-Time Clock (RTC) Battery</h4>
      <p>
        The one reason I hesitate at all to suggest buying an untested PC98 is
        that some of them use Nickel-Cadmium (NiCad) real time clock batteries.
        Every system with one of those should be treated as a time bomb, if
        not already dead. Those NiCad battery barrels seem to be more common
        in older stuff. But they are mounted to the motherboard, so when they
        leak out, they start corroding the copper traces away. If it's not
        caught quickly and treated/cleaned, it can and will kill motherboards.
        If you're not sure which kind of battery a particular model uses,
        proceed with caution.
      </p>
      <p>
        If your system has a barrel battery, I suggest IMMEDIATELY
        clipping/removing it from the board, buying a new battery cell, and
        mounting it in a holder attached to the motherboard via a wire. If there
        was leakage but the board still works, you should polish off the area
        of leakage (down to good copper), use a little alcohol, and then re-seal
        it with nail polish or something similar.
      </p>
      <p>
        It's worth noting that not all RTC batteries are NiCads. I've also seen
        rechargeable coin cell batteries, which seem to be much more reliable.
      </p>
      <p>
        The ones that my friend got ended up not having barrel batteries, but
        I believe the PC98-DO has one and lots of others besides also do.
      </p>
      <h4>Red Flag #5: There is no Red Flag #5</h4>
      <p>
        If you avoid a window accelerator built into the motherboard, and your
        system has FM sound built in (especially a YM2608, for "86-Sound"),
        you have already ensured that your system will be at least largely
        compatible with most older DOS things. If you have a CD drive and
        a non-leaked (or coin cell) clock battery, that's even better.
      </p>
      <h3>So, What Did My Friend Choose?</h3>
      <p>
        My friend chose to get two systems, a PC-9821 Cs2 and a PC-9821 Ce2.
        I believe the idea was that if something was broken, she'd be able to
        swap parts to get at least one system working fully. It ended up being
        a good thing that she did get two, which I also intend to talk about
        in detail later, but for now suffice to say one of the floppy drives
        was unreliable and one of the CD drives didn't work. There was also
        another little incident after arrival that made it doubly good that she
        had both systems. More on that later.
      </p>
      <h3>So, What Did <b>I</b> Choose for Myself?</h3>
      <p>
        Me? Well, I pretty much just ignored all of the above options. NEC?
        Pssh. That's so <i>mainstream</i>. I can do better than that.
      </p>
      <p>
        So, without further ado, allow me to introduce you to my Epson
        PC-486GR (from 1992).
      </p>
      <div class="imgcontain imgwrap" id="486gr_photo_01">
        <a href="pc9801_1/full/486gr_01.jpg">
          <img src="pc9801_1/486gr_01.jpg"
               alt="Epson PC-486GR, set up on my desk with mouse, monitor, flashfloppy drives, and keyboard."/>
        </a>
        <div class="imgwrap caption imgcentercaption">
          Yup; that's masking tape.
        </div>
      </div>
      <p>
        It covers a few of the requirements above, but also lacks a fair number
        of them. I think it should be expandable enough to accomodate most
        of it.
      </p>
      <p>
        Seiko Epson made PC-98 compatible clone computers in the 1980's and
        1990's. It seems to be the only company that ever did, strangely
        enough... apparently, other companies considered it but were
        worried about the loss of reputation that would be involved. And
        NEC definitely was hostile to the idea of competition; they locked
        Epsons out from using its versions of DOS and some of its PC98
        expansion cards in software.
      </p>
      <p>
        There seems to be a lot of FUD (fear, uncertainty, and doubt) regarding
        the Epson clones' compatibility on the English-speaking web, so a large
        part of my reason for choosing this was to call FUDders out on their
        voodoo brand-name attachment (and just generally prove that they are
        wrong to worry about it).
      </p>
      <p>
        Without access to an NEC machine, it's hard to know if the few problems
        I've had are compatibility issues or not, but when my friend with the
        NEC-brand computers has time I'll ask her to try running some of my
        software and we'll see. But I can affirm that pretty much everything
        works; just some of the older software has some glitches which to me
        seems consistent with my expectations. My unit has enhanced graphical
        capabilities compared to early or mid-80's models, and I suspect that
        my problems are simply a result of the upgraded hardware and that mine
        is in fact "bug-compatible" with the 486-class NEC computers.
