          Please note that the writing of this blog post is currently
          underway, limited by my available time to work on it between work, my
          job search, and schooling. It may have omissions, have broken links,
          drop off mid-sentence, or have any number of other issues until it is
          completed. But I <i>WILL</i> finish it.
        </p>
        <p>
          Additionally, I have a friend who is writing about her NEC
          PC-9821's, which she got at around the same time I got my PC.
          Her work will likely appear here, too!

      <p>
        I have sunk a <i><b>lot</b></i> of money into the PC-98 and even more
        of my time collecting and writing all of this documentation. I haven't
        had work since December, and while I've stopped spending on the PC-98
        since then, I've continued writing even as I look for work.
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm not going to stop writing this if I have any say in the matter,
        regardless - but I'd like to ask you to please consider a donation
        as thanks if you've found anything here helpful. I need to keep
        a roof over my head and anything you can drop in the tip jar would
        help.
      </p>
      <p>
        Alternately, if you or someone you know would like to consider hiring
        me, would you please consider <a href="https://tech.lgbt/@wyatt8740">getting in touch</a>?
        I'd also be happy to just give one on one lessons, if you'd like to
        pick my brain about something or get some guidance.
      </p>
      <p>
        You can donate or commission me (including for lessons)
        <a href="https://ko-fi.com/wyatt8740">here on Ko-Fi</a>;
        you'll get fastest responses if you also contact me via that link in

        A good friend of mine recenty convinced me to dive headfirst down the
        rabbit hole of things I didn't really understand: old Japanese domestic
        computers, and particularly the NEC PC-9801 series. After seeing the
        relatively lacking English language documentation available for these
        systems, I now want to document and help others on their own journeys
        to discover more about these computers themselves. Perhaps it will even
        be an interesting read for someone who doesn't intend to get one!
      </p>
      <p>
        So far, this article is on track to be longer than even
        <a href="./007_008.html"> the Bubblegum Crisis posts</a> that I wrote
        before. So again, be warned.
      </p>
      <p>
        I anticipate that this page is going to get rather long, so I'm providing
        a Table of Contents for the core of this post (everything after the
        introduction).

      <h3 id="pc9801_buying_wyatt_motivation">Motivations</h3>
      <p>
        <b>This is mostly a personal section,</b> detailling my philosophy
        behind why I'm doing this and how it came about. If you just want to
        know about the computers and get into the meat of this post, you can
        skip this part and go further down to
        <a href="#pc9801_buying_wyatt_introduction">the introduction</a>, or
        find the point you want to jump in at back in the
        <a href="#pc9801_buying_wyatt_toc">table of contents</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        I recently ended up with a Japanese PC of my own. I got it in part so I
        could help a good friend of mine with a passion for pixel art and a
        fascination with old Japanese computers to dive into and embrace that
        passion for old electronics. I have been swimming in this passion for a
        long time now, but she had felt that it was out of her reach before she
        met me. So my main reasons for getting it were that:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          I would enjoy learning more about it, too,
        </li>
        <li>
          My friend was already determined to get one,
        </li>
        <li>
          I had considerably more pre-existing knowledge about DOS and
          SCSI and other "old computer things" than she did, and
        </li>
        <li>
          I could maybe grease the wheels of learning for her, and help both
          of us to get off the ground faster.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        I think that ended up being a good decision. Old computers aren't like
        most old game consoles; there's a lot more stuff to go wrong with
        them, and parts are more varied and harder to come by. Documentation is
        much more important, and not everything is going to "just work" if
        plugged in.
      </p>
      <p><a href="#pc9801_buying_wyatt_toc">[Top]</a></p>
      <h3>Everything's Better with a Friend!</h3>
      <p>
        So in short, I wanted to accelerate my friend's rate of learning by
        being able to answer her questions as they arose. When I was learning,
        I didn't really have anyone I could ask these kinds of questions a lot
        of the time. Even when I was able to eke an answer out of someone (on
        IRC or wherever), it was often still a little confusing to me, and I
        didn't want to encroach further on peoples' time by asking too many
        follow-up questions and end up annoying them. In these kinds of
        conditions, just learning about the basics of things can take a pretty
        long time. Plus (just between you and me), I'm not naturally inclined
        to thinking in programming terms, I think. I know people who were
        wizards making NES games at age 18, but that was never me. I think I
        was still basically in the "learning C" stage at that point in time.
      </p>
      <p>
        Pretty much nothing has come easily for me, and I didn't have many to
        guide me, since for the most part the stuff that I'm talking about
        right here and now is not commercially viable (thus, courses are not
        offered on most of it besides C and Unix). So I think you basically
        have to either know somebody or else do it the hard way like I've been
        doing it and scrounging around for all the little pieces and trying
        to make sense of them.

        Learning language is much the same way, I think; if you know someone
        and are regularly in contact and interaction with people who speak the
        language, it's much easier than if you are trying to learn just from
        reading the language without that interactive element. But I want to
        have fun in my spare time. So learning a language by going to classes
        and stressing out about my GPA&ndash; learning on a crunch not because
        I want to, but because I have to or else my future is ruined, is not
        ideal for me.
      </p>
      <p>
        That's how learning Japanese has been for me, too. Mostly through
        reading and listening. Ideally, I'd have other people who were better
        than me at the language to try to converse with in it who could help
        me along, but that's just a little tricky to come by in Indiana.
      </p>
      <p>
        My point with these examples is that I think I didn't get much
        handholding early on, and that I think I may have gotten to where I am
        more quickly had I had access to more people whom I could ask my
        questions of (and who were freely sharing knowledge with me). I'd like
        to be that person for my friend&ndash; and maybe also for others who
        read my post, so that's how this all started.
      </p>
      <h4>The Tower of Babel is Populated Solely by Engineers</h4>
      <p>
        I also think a lot of engineering types, even brilliant ones, are kind
        of bad at communicating the things they know in ways that we mere
        mortals may endeavour to understand them. One only has to look at
        wikipedia articles on mathematics&ndash; or maybe on something in
        physics, like
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_temperature?useskin=monobook">color
          temperature</a>, to realize the breadth and severity of this problem.
      </p>
      <p>
        That article is perfectly accurate in what it describes, but it is
        nearly useless for someone like me who was only trying to look up why color
        temperature exists and how it's actually measured or quantified.
      </p>
      <p>
        In that example, the crucial thing I was missing was what
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black-body_radiation?useskin=monobook">"black-body radiation"</a>
        is, but the article on it lacks good practical examples in plain view,
        so all it does is overwhelm me. It is actually something that many
        people have seen before, without even realizing it. It's the reason
        that heated iron (from, say, a blast furnace) glows red when hot&ndash;
        and white when even hotter.
      </p>
      <p>
        The key point that is missing (or presumed to be already known) is
        that <i>everything</i> can glow like that if it is heated enough
        compared to its surroundings. Color temperature is measured in kelvin
        because it can be most easily quantified by describing how much warmer
        than absolute zero a perfectly black object (one that does not reflect
        any light that strikes it) would need to be to glow with that frequency
        (and therefore color) of light.
      </p>
      <p>
        Anyway&ndash; because I didn't have someone to explain things like that
        to me in one place, particularly the iron glowing example, it took me
        <i>years</i> to figure out what color temperature actually
        <i>meant</i>. In this case, with this old technology, I also can have
        trouble finding clear explanations of how things work.
      </p>
      <p>
        Try looking up information on how to write a DOS
        <code>CONFIG.SYS</code> file, for instance, or maybe try to find a
        number in a little-endian hexadecimal dump without realizing that all
        the numbers are going to be in reverse byte order from what is most
        intuitive. So, if looking for hexadecimal <code>0xDEADBEEF</code>,
        you'd need to search for the byte sequence <code>0xEFBEADDE</code> on
        things like Intel computers). Good luck figuring <i>that</i> one out
        on your own if no one's explained endian-ness to you yet!
      </p>
      <p>
        I know there's a lot of information on this page, but maybe by trying
        to describe everything in a somewhat reasonable order and by describing
        terms as they come up, I can avoid some of the failings of Wikipedia at
        being approachable. To this end, I also have a table of contents, so
        that one may jump straight to the thing that interests them, and jump
        back for a definition or prerequisite knowledge as needed.
      </p>
      <p>
        My hope, then, is to at least help people to at least know what
        questions to ask, and perhaps some terms they need to search for.
        Ideally, I'll also be able to answer most of those questions on this
        page clearly enough that the searches are all but unnecessary.
        I want this article to somehow manage to be understandable without
        talking down to anyone. I hope to be able to strike such a balance,
        and to learn what does and doesn't work when teaching others.

        To that end, I think that my friend will probably end up collaborating
        with me on this. I think that her insights and sharing what stuck out
        to her can help me to avoid falling into the engineer's trap of
        assuming that others understand the underlying concepts of their
        ramblings without them having to fully explain it in a way they can
        grasp. And I also am interested to see how much she's learned! We've

      <h2 id="pc9801_buying_wyatt_introduction">Introduction to Japanese Computers</h2>
      <p>
        To be honest, I've always been more of a Sharp X68000 person than a
        PC-98 person, myself. Not because there's anything <i>wrong</i> with
        the 98, though!&ndash; the X68000 is just a much more powerful computer
        if you are interested in playing games, with much stronger graphical
        capabilities in most respects than its competition. It also helps that
        the source code for Human68K (the OS) is available freely.
      </p>
      <p>
        Unfortunately, the X68000 has a few problems if you're looking to
        obtain one in 2023:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          It was only ever sold in Japan (obviously).
        </li>
        <li>
          It needs a 24KHz horizontal scan rate monitor, which almost
          nothing in the US does (even VGA flat screens).</li>
        <li>
          A lot of them have bad surface mount capacitors that leak
          out and destroy their circuitry. This is especially apparent with
          the later, more-powerful ones. Pretty much the same problem all
          Sega Game Gears seem to have.</li>
        <li>
          Almost all documentation is in Japanese&hellip; I am trying to learn
          Japanese, but it's like being thrown in the ocean to learn to swim.
        </li>
        <li>
          A lot of the documentation isn't scanned. I'm guessing this is
          some sort of fear about copyright law and the way it is enforced
          in Japan?
        </li>
        <li>
          It was always the underdog computer in the market, and never sold
          as well as its competitors. It also has a fiercely loyal fan-base
          today. Prices are sky-high (perhaps in part because no one is
          satisfied with just one X68000 and they need to have <i>at least
            one</i> of every model).
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        &hellip;Hey, wait a moment. Haven't I seen this somewhere before?
      </p>
      <div class="imgcontain imgwrap" id="a4000_prices">
        <a href="pc9801_1/full/a4000_prices.png">
          <img src="pc9801_1/a4000_prices.png"
               alt="Amiga 4000 prices on ebay, $3000 plus."/>
        </a>
        <div class="imgwrap caption imgcentercaption">
          The X68000 seems to be pretty much analogous to what the Amiga became here.<br/>
          I'd rather buy a decent used car, personally.
        </div>
      </div>
      <p>
        So basically, much like with Amigas, the continual interest in the
        platform from people with more money than I have has ensured that I've
        written off being able to afford and justify getting an X68000 in the
        near future, barring incredible luck. But I'm still interested in
        Japanese computers; there are a lot of weird designs out there that are
        intriguing to me, and some of them look absolutely <i>gorgeous</i>.
      </p>
      <div class="imgcontain imgwrap" id="sharp_x1">
        <a href="pc9801_1/full/sharp_x1.jpg">

          The Sharp X1. I wish any of my computers looked this good!
        </div>
      </div>
      <p>
        I briefly had considered an X1, which looks stunning, and would also be
        able to run CP/M. But unfortunately (again), there's not much I think I
        would actually <i>do</i> on one, no matter how beautiful it would look
        on my desk. Maybe if I can find a good thing to do on it some day, I'll
        return to thinking about it. The monitor would be pricey, I bet, but
        the X1 computer itself regularly shows up for pretty fair prices
        online, even in red (the objective best color for it).

      <h3>Some Reasons NOT to Buy a Japanese Computer</h3>
      <p>
        So, basically, I'd been considering getting into Japanese computers for
        some time, but never following through. Even ignoring the initial cost
        at auction, the shipping fees would be murder on top of that&hellip; and
        there are all sorts of other considerations that I'd have to make when
        buying one, as well, to actually be able to use it here. For instance,
        what kinds of floppies will they use? Do I want to use real floppies,
        or Gotek-style floppy drive hardware emulators and disk images? How
        will i connect a hard drive? How do I actually <i>power</i> the thing?
        What kind of software can I practically use on it? What kind of screen
        do I need?
      </p>
      <p>
        As you might be able to see, it quickly becomes a logistical nightmare
        and a money pit. I'd experienced some of this with my Amiga 500, but
        was lucky enough to get mine with a correct monitor and hard drive and
        power supplies included in the sale at a really nice price, locally,
        with no shipping fees. But I'd still felt the need to upgrade to a newer
        hard drive and caused endless SCSI headaches in the process. I'd
        upgraded the RAM, added a Genlock to subtitle laserdiscs, put in an ECS
        (enhanced) version of its "Denise" chip to enable higher resolutions,
        added a Kickstart (bootloader ROM) switcher to let me boot newer
        versions of Amiga Workbench (the OS), and all sorts of other things to
        better use it. All of that stuff adds up fast! And to do the same on
        a Japanese computer, many of those purchases would include paying
        shipping fees from about halfway across the planet whenever I ran into
        a new problem that needed a hardware solution.
      </p>
      <p><a href="#pc9801_buying_wyatt_toc">[Top]</a></p>
      <h3>Why I Still Ended Up Getting a Japanese Computer Anyway</h3>
      <p>
        So, knowing all of this would happen, and that it'd be a massive money
        pit, why did I decide to follow through, eventually?
      </p>
      <p>
        Well, basically, it was because of my aforementioned good friend with
        the pixel art passion. I have been helping her on her journey into
        older computers, which were already an interest of mine. That, combined
        with my own predisposition towards interest in old computers, was
        enough to motivate me to bite the bullet. I knew that she'd have an
        uphill battle learning to use one on her own, and that it'd be more
        fun (and simple) for me to help if I had a physical computer of my own,
        too.
      </p>
      <p>
        By the way, the main reason it would be an uphill battle is that she
        had no prior DOS experience in any language, and no exposure to things
        like drive selection jumpers/switches (for IDE hard drives and Shugart
        interface floppy drives), maintaining and cleaning floppy drives,
        formatting floppies for a system that expects 1232KiB disks, or
        transferring information to a PC98 from a modern PC in general. Things
        can break in so many subtle ways with old tech like this, and if you
        don't know what to look for it can be incredibly frustrating. Also, if
        you want to be able to afford it, you often have to look at listings
        for stuff in untested or "junk" condition. Knowing what the signs are
        that something will likely work or be fixable is an art in and of
        itself.
      </p>
      <p>
        This lack of experience can of course all be overcome, but it's a lot
        of learning to do. I figured I could help speed up the process if I
        helped a bit. There'd still be stuff I didn't know about, but at least
        some of my knowledge from other old computers does transfer over. I'm
        happy to say she took to it with gusto, and has learned a ton over a
        very short span of time! And it feels great to have an eager and
        enthusiastic learner who asks all the right questions like she does.
        It's hard for me to believe that about a year ago she was hesitant to
        take apart an old laptop to swap the lid, and now she takes everything
        apart the moment she gets it, just like I do. :)

      <h2>The NEC PC-9801</h2>
      <h3>Why Do People Get a PC-9801?</h3>
      <p>
        My aforementioned good friend had long been enamored specifically with
        the NEC PC-9801 and its descendants. To be completely honest, the PC-98
        has some games with good artwork and stuff, but it was the <i>least</i>
        interesting of the major Japanese platforms to me. It was the one that
        sold the best, and it wasn't <i>particularly</i> speedy or performant.
        It also used x86 CPU's, which means it was the most "IBM-Like" of the
        big platforms, alongside Fujitsu's "FM Towns" line. But the FM Towns
        had more interesting graphical capabilities for playing games and
        multimedia. The draw for the PC-98, for people interested in games,
        seems to be one of three things these days.

          Touhou, a "bullet hell" type shooter game series featuring cutesy
          manga/anime style girl characters which started on the PC-98
          platform. I'd say that (at least from what people <i>say</i> online
          and the frequency with which they say it) this one franchise
          accounts for maybe 40% of the gaming interest in the platform,
          both inside and outside of Japan. The Touhou franchise is still
          ongoing, so that's probably a large part of why it has stayed
          popular while everything else is forgotten.
        </li>
        <li>
          Early PC-98 era computer games, aimed at a general audience. Later
          in the system's lifetime, most people interested in computer games
          moved to other platforms. This means either to game consoles like
          the Famicom, Super Famicom, Mega Drive, and so on, or to other
          computer platforms like the aforementioned X68000 (which had some
          <i>excellent</i> arcade ports) or the FM Towns. Some games in this
          category of early general audience games for PC-98 include some
          great RPG's you may or may not have heard of, such as:
          <ul>
            <li>
              Falcom's <i>Ys</i> franchise, which survives to this day.
            </li>
            <li>
              Glodia's <i>Emerald Dragon</i>, which has a translation on the
              SNES version&hellip; but I like the art on the PC-98 version the
              most.
            </li>
          </ul>
          I'd say that this interest accounts for maybe 5% of the
          outside-of-Japan interest in the system, and I'd guess maybe 15-25%
          of the interest <i>within</i> Japan.
        </li>
        <li>
          Finally, I can't just dance around it forever, so it's best to just
          address it here. Later in the system's lifetime it became a staple
          for visual novels and erotic games (abbreviated as <i>eroge</i>).
          It was very well suited to this, since even though its actual
          performance at animating things on the screen was rather poor, it
          could display somewhat high resolution static graphics in a fair
          number of colors. So it was ideal for visual novels. I'd guess that
          internationally this is 60% of the interest and in Japan it's about
          35% of the interest.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        Additionally, there may be some more interest if someone wants to run
        Linux or similar on it, since buying a domestic 486 PC is not
        significantly less expensive anymore.
      </p>
      <p>
        To be honest, the visual novel and eroge element probably is what
        interests me the <i>least</i> of the above about the 98; I am
        interested most in the computer RPG's that we never got here, both as a
        way to learn some Japanese and because I enjoy the art styles, music,
        and stories. I played a small portion of the English translation of the
        SNES version of 'Emerald Dragon,' and it looks like it might be really,
        really good storywise. I also have played an emulated version of 'Ys'
        and I <i>loved</i> the soundtrack (which was composed by Yuzo Koshiro,
        who later did the music for <i>Streets of Rage</i> and is often
        considered a master of frequency modulation synthesis music).
      </p>
      <p>
        It also can have a Yamaha OPN series frequency modulation (FM) sound
        chip - I'm not aware of any cards featuring this chip on IBM
        compatibles (that is to say, ISA cards). The only things in the west
        that I can think of that have <i>similar</i> sound chips are the Sega
        Genesis (YM2612) and Neo Geo (YM2610)... but the YM2608 is more
        advanced than either of those in most ways.
      </p>
      <p>
        Sure, there are a handful of visual novel-esque games that I would
        really like to play, though. Hideo Kojima's acclaimed <i>Snatcher</i>
        comes to mind, for instance. But that had a Sega CD port (in English,
        I might add), so why not just play that?!

      <h3>Why Did <i>I</i> Get the PC-9801?</h3>
      <h4>(The Influence of Friendship On Financial Decisions)</h4>
      <p>
        In the end, the primary reason i was interested now was because of my
        friend, who has less technical background than I do but who has strong
        interest in learning - not just about the PC-98, but about computing
        and old electronics in general. She has wanted a PC-98 for a long time,
        and asked for my help in figuring out what to get and how to set it up.
      </p>
      <p>
        I decided that it might be fun for me to get one, too, so we could
        figure stuff out together. And such were the mental gymnastics I did to
        get into a buying mood. It also is a somewhat smaller investment than
        an X68000, and with a LOT more supply available for sale in both
        computers and the parts for them, with less intense demand.
      </p>
      <p>
        I have already had a <i>lot</i> of fun teaching my friend and watching
        her gain more confidence with electronics. It seems to have been
        something she had wanted to get into for some time, but didn't know
        where to begin. Having been there myself, I suppose I took some
        sympathy. My desire to share what I've learned with others
        also kicked in, since sharing what I've learned is what I live for.
        Coupled with my own shelved (out of practicality) curiosity about these
        platforms. It simply felt like it might finally be the right time.
      </p>
      <p>
        We had talked a lot about older computers in the past, and I expressed
        that I was somewhat familiar with the Japanese computer platforms, at
        least in theory. And it seemed like a fun thing that we could do
        together. So far, it actually has been, although there have been a few
        bumps in the road. I'll hopefully get around to explaining what exactly
        those bumps are soon. At any rate, I had to start researching the
        PC-9801 series in earnest to prepare us for our respective purchases.

        Alright. Now that we have that 'plug' out of the way, let's get
        started!
      </p>
      <h4 id="pc9801_buying_wyatt_getting_started">Getting Started</h4>
      <p>
        First off, let's a2ddress something very basic but of <b><i>absolutely
            critical</i></b> importance for understanding fully what you are about
        to get yourself into, and how deep you can expect to get into it.
      </p>
      <h3 id="pc9801_buying_wyatt_not_an_ibm_clone">The PC-9801 is NOT an IBM Clone! </h3>
      <p>
        If you came here looking for info on the PC-98 series, and aren't just
        casually reading my blog, then you should already know this&ndash; but
        the NEC PC-9801 and its descendants are <i>not</i> just fancier IBM
        PC's. They <i>do</i> have some similarities, on account of their
        chipsets, but if you want to run programs written for an IBM that
        do <b>ANY</b> BIOS calls or direct hardware access, you can expect
        that it will likely not run on a PC-98. If it only uses MS-DOS/PC-DOS
        API's, though, then you might be fine.
      </p>
      <p>
        For starters, <b>don't just expect that you can install your American
          copy of MS-DOS on a PC-98 and have it work. It will <i>not</i> work. You
          will also have to be able to figure out how to use DOS in Japanese;
          this is most probably totally unavoidable.</b> Things that have been
        unofficially translated for the PC-98 is <b>quite scarce</b> compared
        to all of the impressive accomplishments that have been made by ROM
        hackers and fan translators for game consoles and newer Windows games.
      </p>
      <p>
        Here are some of the hardware and software architectural differences
        between the PC-9801 and IBM-compatibles (known as DOS/V systems in
        Japan) that I have encountered so far, in list form.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Incompatible keyboard protocol and connector</b>:
          <ul>
            <li>No equivalents outside of Japan, except <b>perhaps</b> for
              the NEC APC I, II, and III keyboards (unverified). These are
              <b>pretty hard to find</b> now, and <b>don't have as many keys
                as a PC-9801 keyboard</b>, so some keys may not be usable.
              Plus, anyone who actually has an APC III probably needs one of
              those keyboards more than you do, with how prone to cannibalism
              mechanical keyboard hoarders are and how many systems go up for
              sale on ebay keyboard-less.
            </li>
            <li>
              You will need an NEC PC-9801/9821 keyboard (8801 doesn't work),
              or one made by Epson. I will say more about the Epson board
              option later on.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Incompatible with PS/2 mouse protocol and connector;</b> uses one of
          the following:
          <ul>
            <li>
              Microsoft "InPort" 9 pin mini-DIN bus mouse (later models)
            </li>
            <li>
              An electrically identical mouse with a 9-pin D-sub (earlier
              models)
            </li>
            <li>
              Passive adapters can be used to convert an inPort mouse to a
              D-Sub connector or vice versa. <b>These are NOT the same as
                PS/2 to serial adapters!</b>
            </li>
            <li>
              Quadrature mouses from other computers (Amiga, AT&amp;T 6300,
              and Atari ST, for instance) <b>CAN</b> be used, but must first
              be re-wired. A pre-ADB Macintosh mouse could be adapted, except
              that you'd be not have a right click button&hellip; which you
              will probably need.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Incompatible RGB Video Output, both physically and electronically</b>:
          <ul>
            <li>
              Runs at 640x400. 56.4 Hz vertical refresh rate, 24.81 KHz
              horizontal.
            </li>
            <li>
              Most american market CRT's and even LCD's won't display a
              stable picture with that video mode. Some CRT's may even be
              damaged by attempting to display it. Unless one you are
              thinking of buying <i>specifically</i> claims to cover both
              these horizontal and vertical scan rates, you should assume it
              will not.
            </li>
            <li>
              Uses a DA15 connector for analogue RGB out (but does not use
              the same pinout as the old Macs).
            </li>
            <li>
              Some appear to also offer digital RGB out, but I assume this is
              at the same refresh rates as the analogue output. I doubt that
              EGA monitors (350 lines max, ~21KHz) would sync up properly.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>No ISA bus (uses "C-Bus")</li>
        <li>Completely different BIOS interface/boot process</li>
        <li>Different partition table on hard drives</li>
        <li>
          Floppy drive interface is different
          <ul>
            <li>
              Does not use the cable "twist" like IBM compatibles do
            </li>
            <li>
              <i>Almost</i> a standard Shugart interface (adds/moves density pin, READY pin)
            </li>
            <li>
              Drives must be jumpered to set a "drive ID" (due to lack of cable twist)
            </li>
            <li>
              Up to <b>four</b> floppy drives may be connected at once (instead of two)
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          The floppy drives themselves are a little different
          <ul>
            <li>
              Some later ones (about 1993 onward?) support high-density floppies in 1.44MB format (300RPM), versus 1987 for IBM PC's
            </li>
            <li>
              Prior to 1993-ish, some had high density drives, but they spun 3.5" disks at 360RPM instead of 300RPM to match sector layout and capacity of 5.25" high density disks.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          Uses NEC's
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NEC_%C2%B5PD7220">µPD7220</a>
          graphics controller (and evolutions thereof) instead of an MDA,
          CGA, EGA, Tandy, or VGA chipset. Potentially more than one of them.

      <p>
        So, ya really want to learn about the PC-9801, do ya? Well, first, what
        do you want to do with yours? - depending on your answers to the below
        questions, some models may be preferable over others.
      </p>
      <p>
        Since there was never a "PC-98 building industry" to my knowledge,
        given the proprietary nature of the platform, you will have to settle
        for an OEM-made machine. This makes choosing the correct one for your
        needs even more important, since it's much less likely you can just
        pop something out of a socket and upgrade it later (on many models).
        Many have soldered-down CPU's, for instance, which obviously precludes
        most people from being able to upgrade them.
      </p>
      <p>
        The PSU's are similarly designed for the power budget of the machine as
        it came configured, with some overhead for cards. The connectors are
        not necessarily going to be standardized, and I doubt that most will
        accept an AT or ATX PSU. So if you want to upgrade your PSU, you may
        end up having to hunt for a related model that came from the factory
        with a beefier PSU to steal parts from - or perhaps you will be able
        to do a custom wiring job, if you're confident with that, and make
        some other PSU work.
      </p>
      <p>
        Finally, even if something looks like a standard connector, don't take
        that for granted. Do your research first! Don't just assume the best
        of all possible worlds, where everything works with everything, because
        I think it's safe to say we aren't in Kansas anymore.

          <a href="./007_008.html#bubblegum-review-1">Bubblegum Crisis</a>
          game on the PC-9801!)
        </div>
      </div>
      <p>
        Regarding the above picture, Bubblegum Crisis is actually an example of
        a game where the system you choose matters. The game uses FM sound, so
        it needs to be new enough for that, and it also makes no attempt to
        throttle itself to match the framerate of the screen - it just runs at
        full-tilt all the time, so you have to be able to make the computer run
        slow enough for it to be playable. It's comically fast at 75 MHz.
      </p>
      <p><a href="#pc9801_buying_wyatt_toc">[Top]</a></p>
      <h4>DOS, Windows, or Other?</h4>
      <p>
        If you intend to get a PC-98 and run Windows programs on it, you can
        basically treat it as an IBM-compatible PC running that version of
        Windows, except with a Japanese locale. I see little reason to do this,
        unless you really want a 486 running Windows but don't like the prices
        on IBM-compatible 486'es.
      </p>
      <p>
        It has also been said by many that the 98 series lost its "98-ness" in
        the mid 90's with the rise of Windows, as the computers moved away from
        the old µPD7220-derived design to using third-party GPU's that were
        more adept at accelerating 2D window management operations. These
        graphics chips were things made by companies like S3, and stripped away
        another bit of uniqueness from the series. Later models also introduced
        features like PCI card slots. The PC-98 series rapidly moved towards
        being just a "Windows PC," compatible with win16/win32 programs made
        for IBM-compatible Wintel machines. DOS compatibility still existed to
        an extent, but the further away NEC moved, the more stuff began to
        break in DOS-land, where direct hardware access was still king.
      </p>
      <p>
        Thus, it seems that the PC-98 might have been one of the last
        non-IBM-compatible, non-Apple consumer personal computer series to
        survive in any form. But if you want to run Windows, why not just run
        Windows on an IBM-compatible...?
      </p>
      <p>
        In my personal opinion, the real reasons one should want a PC-9801 are
        some combination of game software, potentially learning Japanese, and
        maybe running free operating systems like the BSD's or Linux distros.
        There is very little attractive about the machines for plain old
        Windows use. In my case I keep a Gateway E-3200 (Pentium 3) around for
        my old Windows software use. It runs US English Windows 98 and Japanese
        Windows 2000, and packs a Voodoo3 GPU; this puts me in a good spot for
        anything I might really want to play in the Windows world, since I'm
        not really too interested in modern Windows games.
      </p>
      <h4>You Have Selected: DOS</h4>
      <p>
        I will just assume you can take a hint and realized that above I was
        essentially saying that DOS is the only real choice here for games, if
        you don't want your computer to be "just another old Windows PC."
      </p>
      <p>
        The rest of this article will probably not focus on Windows much, if at
        all. Maybe I'll cover N88-BASIC and/or other OS'es, some day, though.
      </p>
      <p><a href="#pc9801_buying_wyatt_toc">[Top]</a></p>
      <hr/>
      <h3 id="pc9801_buying_wyatt_what_are_my_options">What are My Options for Hardware, then?</h3>
      <p>
        I stumbled my way into my choice based on a combination of factors.
        First of all, as mentioned above, I wanted it to be viable for DOS
        games. I also wanted it to be new enough to be able to run the same
        things my friend was running, which are largely from the era where the
        games don't look quite "8-bit" anymore and the pixel art can be more
        intricate. I also wanted it to be capable of FM sound (Yamaha YM2203 or
        YM2608). These chips have a lot in common with the YM2612 chip used in
        the Sega Mega Drive/Genesis consoles. I also desired expandability,
        the ability to use a hard drive, and to be honest I sort of wanted
        to do something no one else was doing.
      </p>
      <p>
        So, if you want a PC-98 for DOS, and you don't want to buy one for
        early games and another for late games, I'd say a 486 or 386 is the
        ideal range to choose from. Circa perhaps 1990 to 1994. You can find a
        list of a whole bunch of machines
        <a href="https://pc-9800.net/">on this site</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        First, I helped my friend to choose something. She already kind of
        knew what she wanted, so all I really had to do was cross reference
        the models she talked about with the ones on that site to check for
        red flags.
      </p>
      <h4>PC-9801 or PC-9821?</h4>
      <p>
        The PC-9801 was the original series of computers. The best way to
        describe the differences might just be to show how the PC-9801 and
        PC-9821 lines tended to differ.
      </p>
      <p>
        This distinction is for the most part illusory. There are certain
        things correlated with one series or the other, and the original
        target markets for the two lines were different, but being badged
        a "PC-9821" originally was supposed to signify that it was
        "Windows-ready" and better for multimedia, as far as I can tell.
        Some PC-9821's were still sold with just MS-DOS installed and
        without hard drives, so 9821 does not necessarily mean "Windows"
        in all cases.
      </p>
      <h4>9821:</h4>
      <p>
        The PC-9821 models came out targetted at use by Windows users, and have
        some quality of life improvements. For instance, to change settings on a
        PC-9801, you flip a bunch of DIP switches and need to have documentation
        to discover what they do (they are not necessarily marked on the board).
        But with the 9821, by holding the 'HELP' key while booting, you can
        enter a software configurator which shows you virtual dip switches that
        you can flip, with inline help text describing what each switch is
        doing. It can be a real time saver.
      </p>
      <p>
        The 9821 line also usually has different floppy disk drives - from what
        I can gather, the 9801 series usually had 5.25" and the 9821 usually
        had 3.5". Since 3.5" floppies are a LOT easier to come by in good
        shape, and just generally age a little better, that may be one reason
        to consider using a PC-9821 if you intend to keep the original floppy
        drives.
      </p>
      <p>
        It should be noted that <i>on the PC-98</i>, it is possible to write
        any PC-98 5.25" floppy disk image to a 3.5" floppy disk and it will
        work (if the computer and drive both can handle the density/coercivity
        of the media). You may have to reformat the disk first if using a
        western market disk, but 'ufiformat' on Linux can do it. This is to
        say, the PC-98 treats 3.5" floppy drives as just miniaturized 5.25"
        drives, with the same numbers of tracks and sectors as a 5.25" disk.
        Later ones (mostly 9821's) can also support 1.44MB formatted
        high density disks, but most software was distributed on 1.2MB disks.
      </p>
      <p>
        A 9821 is also much more likely to come with an IDE hard disk drive,
        or at least with a controller and connector for one. Typically, with
        a 9801, you need to use a SCSI controller and SCSI drives to get large
        storage capabilities. I personally struggle to make SCSI do what I want
        sometimes, and documentation on many PC-98 SCSI controllers seems
        relatively poor, so that might be another argument for using a 9821.
      </p>
      <p>
        As will be seen below, there is one major reason apart from CPU speed
        (and even more important than CPU speed, arguably) not to get most
        9821 models: western graphics accelerator chipsets for Windows which
        are not entirely compatible with DOS games written with the uPD7220
        and its evolutions in mind. Some may work, some may not. Read on.
      </p>
      <h4>9801:</h4>
      <p>
        The 9801's were intended to be DOS machines; it may be easier to find a
        low-powered one, and it will <i>definitely</i> be easier to find one
        without a window accelerator GPU built-in. They seem to be generally
        less desirable than the early 9821's. Also, this is just something I
        have heard, but people say it's harder to open up the earlier 9801's
        (although later ones are probably pretty okay).
      </p>
      <p><a href="#pc9801_buying_wyatt_toc">[Top]</a></p>
      <h3>Yeah, But What Does All of That Mean?</h3>
      <p>
        I threw around a lot of terms describing the differences between the
        9801 and 9821. To elaborate a little, here's some more detailed
        explanations of what you should try to look for or avoid.
      </p>
      <h4>Red Flag #1: Leaking Real-Time Clock (RTC) Battery</h4>
      <p>
        The one reason I hesitate at all to suggest buying an untested PC-98 is
        that some of them use Nickel-Cadmium (NiCad) real time clock batteries.
        Every system with one of those should be treated as a time bomb, if
        not already dead. Those NiCad battery barrels seem to be more common
        in older stuff. But they are mounted to the motherboard, so when they
        leak out, they start corroding the copper traces away. If it's not
        caught quickly and treated/cleaned, it can and will kill motherboards.
        If you're not sure which kind of battery a particular model uses,
        proceed with caution.
      </p>

        <div class="imgwrap caption imgcentercaption">
          My Commodore Amiga A501 memory expansion board - another victim of
          clock NiCad battery leakage.<br/>
          Oftentimes with old computers, the battery is on the motherboard itself, and it takes the motherboard with it.
        </div>
      </div>
      <p>
        If your system has a barrel battery, I suggest IMMEDIATELY
        clipping/removing it from the board, buying a new battery cell, and
        mounting it in a holder attached to the motherboard via a wire. If there
        was leakage but the board still works, you should polish off the area
        of leakage (down to good copper), use a little alcohol, and then re-seal
        it with nail polish or something similar.
      </p>
      <p>
        It's worth noting that not all RTC batteries are NiCads. I've also seen
        rechargeable coin cell batteries, which seem to be much more reliable.
      </p>
      <p>
        The ones that my friend got ended up not having barrel batteries, but
        I believe the PC-98DO has one and lots of others besides also do.
      </p>
      <h4>Red Flag #2: Integrated window accelerator graphics chip</h4>
      <p>
        Onboard window accelerator cards are for making Windows run with nice
        effects, like showing the contents of windows while dragging them
        around. Unfortunately, these machines force you to use that graphics
        chipset; there's no way to just "unplug" it and go back to using
        the old µPD7220 derivatives. So my friend needed to rule out
        <i>most</i> of the PC-9821 line. <b>But</b>, some of the early ones
        still had either no GPU card built in, or else simply had an
        accelerator card pre-installed that could easily be popped out.
      </p>
      <h4 id="pc9801_buying_wyatt_no_fm_sound">Red Flag #3: No FM sound</h4>
      <p>
        Some later systems omitted the FM sound, especially laptop PC-98
        models. We didn't look at the laptop models in much detail, though,
        since my friend very clearly expressed that she wanted a desktop model.
        Early models lacking FM sound are far too old to be able to play any
        but the oldest PC-98 DOS games at a decent speed.
      </p>
      <p>
        From what I can tell, NEC <b>never made any laptops with FM sound</b>
        that did not have a built-in graphics accelerator of some kind.
        So beware. However, in the section about what I bought below (I did not
        buy a laptop), I will mention one or two possible workarounds. The
        first is to look for some Epson computer models; the second is to
        find a YMF288-based FM PCMCIA card for partial compatibility.
        One such card is the
        <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20240405164634/https://buyee.jp/mercari/item/m97467363807">Panasonic CF-VEW213P</a>;
        I have also seen talk of QVision Wavemaster cards that accomplish the
        same thing. Neither will be cheap, but maybe after shipping it's better
        than importing a desktop?
      </p>
      <p>
        There are other PCMCIA FM cards for the laptop/note models listed
        <a href="https://www.vogons.org/viewtopic.php?p=1016424#p1016424">here on this Vogons thread</a>,
        and maybe  even more of them that I haven't heard of. I decided high
        prices for partial compatibility wasn't something that interested me.
      </P>
      <p>
        There are two main kinds of FM sound chips to consider; the "26-Sound"
        and "86-Sound." If your system has 26-sound, it's much better than
        nothing, but be forewarned that you might still end up springing for a
        PC-9801-86 sound card board if you want stereo sound, PCM audio
        playback, or Atari-style joystick compatibility. And that card on its
        own seems to cost upwards of $100 USD. So factor that in when ordering.
      </p>
      <p>
        The PC-9801-26K card is a cheaper option, but still over $50 plus
        shipping. And if your machine isn't new enough to have an integrated
        26K, then it may be too weak for most <i>later</i> DOS games
        graphically and processor-wise.
      </p>
      <p>
        Some 9821's (most, if not all, actually) have the "86 Sound" (YM2608)
        built-in. On these systems, you can connect a joystick to the system
        via an adapter that plugs into the keyboard port. I might add a
        diagram for this at some point, but basically you need to ground
        one or two wires and then hook the remaining pins up to the joystick
        inputs. People on yahoo auctions will sell you pre-made adapter cables,
        and I didn't have too much trouble finding instructions for making one.
        I am also feeling kind of lazy at the moment, given how much devotion
        I am putting into just writing this article as it is. The VGA adapter
        diagram elsewhere in this post took over an hour to research, draw, and
        make it look all nice in the page. So did the other mouse adapter one.
      </p>
      <h4>Red Flag #4: No CD Drive</h4>
      <p>
        This isn't an instant "NEVER buy this" or anything, but if you don't
        have a CD drive built in, you may have to add one via a SCSI
        controller card for some games. So be sure to factor in that additional
        cost, if having a CD drive actually matters to you.
      </p>
      <p>
        People have been doing work on adding CD digital audio (CDDA) playback
        to solutions like SCSI2SD (ZuluSCSI), but as of my writing this it
        seems most if not all existing ZuluSCSI boards do not have the
        necessary hardware wired up for audio output, so there is still value
        in a physical CD drive, even beyond it just "feeling right" - but
        if you don't need music via CD playback, then ZuluSCSI boards can
        emulate a data CD drive, which is enough for installing something like
        Windows 98 or some games.
      </p>
      <p>
        Also, if you do this, you should probably try to find an NEC branded
        external drive, since while there is a generic driver, it is buggy with
        CD audio playback and I've not managed to fix it yet or find anyone
        else who has already done it for me. NEC's drivers only seem to like
        NEC's SCSI drives. For data (non-music playback), the third party
        driver works fine.
      </p>
      <h4>Red Flag #5: There is no Red Flag #5</h4>
      <p>
        If you avoid a window accelerator built into the motherboard, and your
        system has FM sound built in (especially a YM2608, for "86-Sound"),
        you have already ensured that your system will be at least largely
        compatible with most older DOS things. If you have a CD drive and
        a non-leaked (or coin cell) clock battery, that's even better.
      </p>
      <p>
        I guess I could say "dirty computers are less likely to be good than
        ones that look well cared for," or that "rusty computers are a red
        flag," but it really depends on where the rust is and the extent of the
        rust. There are other things I might be able to say, too, but I can't
        think of them offhandedly and the above are the HUGE ones.
      </p>
      <p>
        An untested computer is much, much, <b>much</b> more likely to work
        than one that is listed as being broken. In my experience, with most
        things that aren't overly mechanical in nature, operation can mostly
        be taken as a given unless otherwise specified. And you can get much
        better prices for untested stuff a lot of the time. Plus, if it doesn't
        work but was untested, sometimes I've been able to fix it up without
        much effort compared to one that was (for instance) known to be killed
        by a lightning strike.
      </p>
      <p>
        I might just add that you shouldn't be dependent on the hard drive
        (if yours is sent with one) still working. Have contingency plans.

      <h2 id="pc9801_buying_wyatt_what_my_friend_bought">What My Friend Bought (and Her Experiences)</h2>
      <p>
        My friend chose to get two systems, a PC-9821 Cs2 and a PC-9821 Ce2.
        I believe the idea was that if something was broken, she'd be able to
        swap parts to get at least one system working fully. It ended up being
        a good thing that she did get two, which I also intend to talk about
        in detail later, but for now suffice to say one of the floppy drives
        was unreliable and one of the CD drives didn't work. There was also
        another little incident after arrival that made it doubly good that she
        had both systems. More on that later.

          feels infinitely better to type on.<br/>
        </div>
      </div>
      <p>
        Actually, she <i>initially</i> bought two, but ended up with four after
        a couple of misadventures. She accidentally scratched some traces on
        the motherboard of her first Ce2 and bought another Ce2 (PC-9821 number
        3) to replace it; then, right after she placed an order on that, I
        found a really, really nice condition Ce2 with absolutely no corrosion
        that had everything but the monitor. I believe I found that by
        searching for "PC-9821ce2" (or maybe "pc9821 ce2") with different
        spacing and punctuation. It was in too good of shape for her to pass
        up.
      </p>
      <p>
        I still believe I will likely be able to fix the Ce2 with the cut
        traces if she ever sends it my way, and also that she might be able to
        do it herself if she keeps it around for a year or two while practicing
        soldering on other things in the meantime. But for now, she has three
        working units and one that will probably work fine once the traces are
        repaired.
      </p>
      <p>
        She didn't at first realize why it had failed; it stopped working after
        she took it all apart and put it back together, and sent me a bunch of
        photos of the motherboard for me to inspect. She had rested the floppy
        drive mounting cage on the motherboard and probably run it back and
        forth along those traces, basically sawing through them.
      </p>
      <p>
        In my opinion, they look much cuter than the computer I ended up
        getting, but that's fine. From what I can tell, I like both hers and
        mine.

        Sorry for the misdirection! - There was actually a <i>third</i> option
        (beyond the 9801 and the 9821) which I purposefully neglected to
        mention. The moral is, don't let people like me make you believe that
        only what we're presenting are options! Even if I don't mean badly, I
        could simply be misinformed or underinformed. I highly suggest not

        Seiko Epson made PC-98 compatible clone computers in the 1980's and
        1990's. It seems to be the only company that ever did, strangely
        enough... apparently, other companies considered it but were
        worried about the loss of reputation that would be involved. And
        NEC definitely was hostile to the idea of competition; they locked
        Epsons out from using its versions of DOS and some of its PC-98
        expansion cards in software.

        I was able to do a little research before buying mine, and there was
        plenty of talk about the Epsons on the web (in Japanese) and I did not
        find a single mention of incompatibility other than in that NEC itself
        added "Epson checks" to some of its cards' boot ROM's and to some
        versions of NEC's MS-DOS variant for the 98 series that would make
        the computers fail to boot (an act of blatant anticompetitive sabotage,
        if you ask me). See also

        But anyway, NEC did something similar with its releases of MS-DOS
        between versions 3.3 and 5.0H for the PC-9800 series computers. It
        performed the aforementioned "Epson check," where it checks the
        computer's boot ROM and possibly others(?) for an NEC copyright string.
        If not found, it sends the PC into a reboot loop.

        This is similar to the Sega "Trademark Security System" or Nintendo's

      <div class="codewrap">
        <div class="quote">
          <p>
            <i>"Hey! You copied our proprietary string of characters that we
              deliberately used to lock you out and control our monopoly over a
              market! THAT'S COPYRIGHT VIOLATION! MODS! BAN THIS EVIL COMPANY FROM
              DOING BUSINESS IN <b>OUR</b> FREE MARKET THAT ONLY WE ARE ALLOWED TO

            other entity that perverts the original intended purpose of

          </p>
        </div>
      </div>
      <p>
        Since the purpose of copyright law isn't to act as <i>de facto</i>
        patents, Sega was told they couldn't do that and use it to lock out
        unlicensed developers if these sorts of small bits of data were needed
        in order to achieve interoperability and allow others to compete on a
        platform. This was deemed as fair use. I do not think Japan itself ever
        had such a ruling... I may be wrong on that. Maybe they have by now,
        but given the abysmal state of copyright law there I'd assume not.
      </p>
      <h4>Patching the "Epson Check"</h4>
      <p>
        In any case, Epson created a "Software Installation Program (SIP),"
        which took NEC's DOS files and patched the copyright check so that it
        would pass on their systems. If this were in the US, I'm sure that NEC
        would argue that it was an unauthorized "derivative work" and go after
        them that way, but it seems that such a technique was considered fine
        inside Japan, at least at that time. Even though it sounds pretty much
        like how ROM hacks are made.
      </p>
      <p>
        I haven't found a copy of the SIP, but there is a free (as in "Free
        Beer," not "Freedom") program for DOS that accomplishes the same thing
        called <i>DISPELL</i>. It used to be available on vector.co.jp, but
        appears to have been erased in the last couple years after being online
        for a decade or more. Its page is
        <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20211020051818/https://www.vector.co.jp/soft/dos/util/se001911.html">archived here</a>,
        or more directly can be downloaded here: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190331040503/http://ftp.vector.co.jp/00/19/531/dspl113.lzh">dspl113.lzh</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        If I remember correctly, the way I used it was first booting into DOS
        6.2 and then inserting my floppy with a different version of DOS on it,
        and running:
      </p>
      <div class="codewrap">
        <pre class="block"> 
          &gt; DISPELL.EXE /A &lt;drive letter&gt;:
        </pre>
      </div>
      <p>
        This was
        enough to get a bootable DOS 3.3 floppy which I then used to launch
        Popful Mail, since Popful mail refuses to run on DOS 5 or 6. I think
        it's also possible to run DISPELL and tell it to patch just individual
        files, which might be preferable if you encounter a game that comes
        with DOS on it which seems to just go through a reboot loop constantly.
        In that case, you'd just want to provide the file names of the dos
        files on the disk. Be sure you also run <code>dir /a</code> to see any
        possible hidden files! And make a backup before you run the patcher.
      </p>
      <p>
        I don't actually know what the <code>/A</code> parameter in DISPELL's
        case does. I didn't bother to translate it yet. If it were open
        sourced, I would have made a translated English patch for you guys. :(
      </p>
      <p>
        It may still be possible to make a translation patch like that with
        just a binary to work with, but I don't know if I feel motivated enough
        to try to cram the english text into the pre-allocated space for a
        Japanese string (or else changing the pointers everywhere in the
        program). But for now, there seems to be a guide in Japanese
        <a href="http://j02.nobody.jp/jto98/e_desk_os/ec_d.htm">here</a> that
        might help (it has pictures).
      </p>
      <p>
        To open the archive, LZH files can be opened in 7-zip, but there's also
        LZH (or is the program name LHA?) for the PC-98 if you want to unpack
        it there. I forget if it's compatible with the LHA files that the Amiga
        crowd often will use for distributing files. Also, Windows XP and
        higher should be able to open it just like zip files, albeit in
        Japanese releases only.
      </p>
      <p>
        Regardless, by the time of 6.2, this "Epson check" had been  had been
        removed, and NEC's version of MS-DOS 6.2 works fine on Epson computers
        with no modifications needed.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Epson version of DOS seems to have a few nice extras sprinkled in,
        like a way to change the console colors at boot-up and a a fancy boot
        splash screen.
      </p>
      <p>
        Without access to an NEC machine, it's hard to
        know if the few problems I've had are compatibility issues or not, but
        when my friend with the NEC-brand computers has time I'll ask her to
        try running some of my software and we'll see. But I can affirm that
        pretty much everything works; just some of the older software has some
        glitches which to me seems consistent with my expectations. My unit has
        enhanced graphical capabilities compared to early or mid-80's models,
        and I suspect that my problems are simply a result of the upgraded
        hardware and that mine is in fact "bug-compatible" with the 486-class
        NEC computers.
      </p>
      <p>
        There are also some ways that it might be considered to be <i>more</i>
        compatible than NEC's from its era. Check this out.

      <p>
        Some of Epson's computers seem to have one additional awesome feature
        which I was not aware of when I bought mine: apparently, you can use
        one
        <a href="https://98epjunk.shakunage.net/fdd/terminal_fdd_mode.html">as
          an external floppy drive bay for another PC.</a> I first discovered
        this about them about a month after getting mine while reading through
        a Japanese message board
        <a href="https://kizuna.5ch.net/test/read.cgi/i4004/1525089405/?v=pc#830">
          thread archive.</a> You can even use one of the supported Epson PC
        models as an external drive for an NEC PC-9801. The one limitation
        appears to be that only 1.2MB HD disks are supported in this mode
        (not single density, DD, or 1.44MB HD disks). Thankfully, just about
        everything I care about apart from ys is on HD media anyway. This
        feature seems to be endemic to Epson's PC-98 compatibles; this mode
        does not exist on any NEC models to my knowledge.
      </p>
      <p>
        Given the prices of Epson PC's compared to external floppy drives, I am
        seriously considering getting another Epson at some point just for
        filling this role. Supported models (or at least some of them) seem to
        be:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          PC-286VJ
        </li>
        <li>
          PC-386G, GE, GS, P
        </li>
        <li>
          PRO-486
        </li>
        <li>
          PC-486P(?)
        </li>
        <li>
          PC-486GF, GR, GR+, GR Super
        </li>
        <li>
          PC-486HA, HX, HG
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        It appears that soft DIP switches 2-7 and 2-4 might need to be changed,
        but I am having trouble deciphering what their values should be for
        correct operation. If the software configurator lets you flip both,
        then both. Otherwise, I would try just setting switch 2-4 first and
        seeing what happens. I think 2-7 is only needed if your system has
        three internal floppy disk drives. Mine (regrettably) does not have the
        5.25" drive.
      </p>
      <p>
        2-4 is the "FDD terminal mode" switch on my PC-486GR, as seen below.
      </p>

      <p>
        The last thing about this terminal mode to note is that you can use
        either a real 'external FDD' cable or a standard(ish) style 50-pin
        SCSI "Centronics" cable for the physical connection between the two
        computers.

      <h3 id="pc9801_buying_wyatt_epson_laptops">Laptop Features</h3>
      <p>
        You may recall that I said in the
        <a href="#pc9801_buying_wyatt_no_fm_sound">"red flags" section</a>
        that no PC-98 laptops without a window accelerator chip built-in have
        FM sound. this seems to definitely be true, from the documentation I
        have seen, but only because I specified that <i>"<b>NEC</b> never made
          any."</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        Because guess what?
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="https://kizuna.5ch.net/test/read.cgi/i4004/1525089405/?v=pc#912">
          Epson <i>did</i> make (some of) them.
        </a>
      </p>
      <p>
        Due to Epson's "upgradeability" as a marketing feature, it looks like it
        was made possible to swap one screen for another after buying if you wanted
        an upgrade; due to this, giving model numbers is kind of meaningless, but
        if you <a href="https://pc-9800.net/db_epson/note_index.htm">start
          with the 1993 models here</a> you will see the ones that came with color
        screens in "stock" configuration.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, you should be warned that many if not practically all of them
        no longer have functioning screens, according to others. They seem
        prone to dissolving into some strong-smelling vinegar-like substance
        with age. I am not sure how feasible it would be to replace the LCD
        with something newer. But I do believe that it might be possible to
        hijack the external RGB output from the back of it and feed it back
        in, if you were dedicated and could find a tiny panel that would
        accept its resolution. I have not seen evidence of people doing this
        (although I did not look particularly hard for such evidence either).
      </p>
      <p>
        They should be usable as desktop machines plugged into an external
        screen, but why not just get a desktop with actual C-bus card support
        at that point?
      </p>
      <p>
        I love the idea of the laptops. And the looks. I'm just not sure which
        if any of them are not prone to dissolving their own screens and
        haven't spent quite enough time researching them. If you are certain
        that your screens won't decay and you have a choice between a TFT and
        an STN panel, take a TFT. Unless you like and feel nostalgic for how
        blurry early color LCD's were (and for the really bad viewing angles
        and contrast dials). I think they're kind of neat; my thinkpad 350 has
        an STN panel.
      </p>
      <p>
        It may be worth noting that it appears at least <i>some</i> laptops
        can have an expansion box plugged in containing multiple C-bus slots.
        So if you want to set up a laptop as a desktop, this may actually
        be feasible. I don't know what those parts cost now, however.

      <h3 id="pc9801_buying_wyatt_things_to_look_for">Things I Looked for When Purchasing</h3>
      <p>
        A lot of this section will likely be common sense, but I still think
        that that common sense is only 'common' if you already happen to know
        a bit about how these computers are put together. So perhaps not as
        much to a westerner like myself. If I sound like I'm babying you,
        that is not my intent; I just would rather say too much than not
        enough.
      </p>
      <p>
        While you can't prepare for everything, here's some points to keep in
        mind.
      </p>
      <h4>"Junk" listings</h4>
      <p>
        Lots of japanese sellers list PC-98's as "junk." This may or may not be
        actually broken. Lots of the time, if something can't be tested, or is
        in less than stellar condition, it will be listed as junk. You may be
        able to get a good deal on something like this. My friend got at least
        two or three of their PC-98's as "junk."
      </p>
      <p>
        I've gotten multiple Famicoms listed as "junk" over the years, and all
        have worked except one - and on that one, it worked after i cleaned
        some corrosion off of the pin connector.
      </p>
      <h4>Rust</h4>
      <p>
        I personally try to avoid rusty listings, but if the corrosion is
        minimal and confined to, say, the expansion  slot covers on the back,
        then it probably was just stored in a somewhat humid environment for a
        long time. It's probably fine inside. But your eyes can be the judge.
        Super rusty listings should probably be avoided unless you have very
        good reasons to be interested in them (like accelerator boards, cards,
        and so on).
      </p>
      <p>
        A <b>lot</b> of PC-98 listings seem to have some rust on them. three of
        four of my friend's have <i>some</i> rust on them, an they all worked
        when they arrived. My Epson was spotless, however.
      </p>
      <h4>Original boxes</h4>
      <p>
        If something still has its original box, that probably will serve as
        <b>the</b> ideal shipping container for it. It's probably the best
        way to buy a CRT, and I'd say things with hard drives especially are
        much more likely to survive shipping if in their original containers.
      </p>
      <p>
        Also, anecdotally, I find that people who keep boxes tend to keep their
        stuff in nice shape.
      </p>
      <h4>Cards present in back of computer</h4>
      <p>
        If a computer has cards plugged into it, then those are cards you
        likely won't need to buy separately later! It also means the computer
        is less likely to have been gutted/parted out to maximize profits,
        and probably still contains whatever internal upgrades it may have had
        (if any).
      </p>
      <h4>Missing slot covers</h4>
      <p>
        If a computer has multiple missing card slot covers on the back, it's
        a pretty solid sign that the seller has removed cards that it used to
        have in order to sell separately. Although I suppose it's also possible
        the original owner just moved the cards to their new PC-98 if they
        replaced it at some point.
      </p>
      <p>
        I try to discourage sellers from doing this kind of thing, so I
        personally try to avoid such listings.
      </p>
      <h4>Confirmation of operation</h4>
      <p>
        Obviously, it is ideal if the seller can confirm that the PC you are
        buying is still fully functional. But you can often get better deals on
        stuff where it has not been. Usually, in my experience, 'unconfirmed'
        operation genuinely is just that, rather than a CYA cop-out by the
        seller trying to avoid returns and pushing known broken goods.
      </p>
      <p>
        My monitor was tested to power on but the seller didn't have anything
        to connect to it to confirm that it worked. They said they suspected it
        was fine because the screen 'turned white' (or something like that) when
        powered on. Indeed, when I got it, it turned on just fine.
      </p>
      <h4>Cables</h4>
      <p>
        If buying a monitor, some of them have detachable video cables. Make
        sure you get one with the cable, or that you can find one from
        somewhere else! The same is true for other things; if you can get it
        with a power cord, or with the little pass through video cable some
        video cards use, and so on, then it is more likely to be the ones
        originally coupled with the system and evidence it has not been parted
        out.
      </p>
      <h4>Peripherals</h4>
      <p>
        You'll almost definitely want a mouse, and you <b>certainly</b> need a
        keyboard. If you can get your PC with one or both of those included,
        that's stuff you don't have to buy separately later. My Epson came
        with its original keyboard, although I eventually bought a 9801V board
        after my friend talked about how nice hers felt. I don't regret it,
        but if you're trying to save some money, keyboards are kind of bulky to
        ship so you'll definitely save on shipping if your PC comes with one.
      </p>
      <p>
        Game controllers can also be a good thing to look for; apart from being
        generally useful, I'd suspect stuff that comes with game controllers is
        more likely to have been upgraded internally from stock configuration!
      </p>
      <h4>Cards</h4>
      <p>
        If your prospective PC model does not have "86 sound" built in (YM2608
        chip), then you should see if any of the ones for sale have a
        PC-9801-86 card (or equivalent) in them, still. I doubt you will have
        much success, given what those go for online, but if you can find it
        it'd be something you don't end up shelling out for later. Likewise,
        a SCSI controller (for computers without IDE) is a huge bonus. So are
        MIDI interface cards. If you're buying a really old model, you may
        need a bus mouse card as well; those can be hard to come by, so if
        you can find a PC that still has one in it, that's perfect. Even a
        "26 sound" card is a huge improvement over not having FM at all, since
        a lot of stuff still did support 26 sound pretty late on. If you are
        looking at models that don't have 26 sound integrated, those cards are
        also handy.
      </p>
      <p>
        I would
      </p>
      <p>
        Finally, it appears there are C-bus cards out there that just contain
        RAM, which can be used to upgrade the memory of a system. If your
        PC has a special slot for RAM upgrades, you should use that instead
        (it might be faster or allow for larger ram upgrades), but if not,
        then more RAM is nearly always better than less. I think you will
        mostly find those in 80's era PC-98's.
      </p>
      <p>
        Modem cards are pretty useless, in my opinion, but maybe someone
        needs one of those? - They are a pretty common sight inside PC's
        for sale.

        Ethernet cards are handy for connecting other computers to your
        PC-98 or transferring files. I don't have one of these, but if
        you are looking you should try to find one with an
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attachment_Unit_Interface">"AUI" connector</a>
        (15 pin D-Sub), or even better with a modern RJ45 ethernet connector
        for twisted pair. Many ethernet cards you will see just have BNC
        connectors on the back. These should be avoided unless you already
        have an adapter to convert that to twisted pair, or if you are
        only connecting to other vintage computers that use BNC coaxial
        ethernet. The adapters to twisted pair from BNC are very expensive,
        last I checked; AUI to twisted pair was easier to find and cheaper.
        Cards with both AUI and BNC connectors will be fine, too.
      </p>
      <h4>Original Documentation/Software</h4>
      <p>
        Mine came with neither documentation nor software, unfortunately - but
        if you see a listing that does, it might be worth it, especially if
        you're worried about keeping your software licensing kosher, since
        it's one less thing to need to buy separately. If you live in a
        country where no one cares about people copying 30-40 year old
        software that hasn't been available to buy for decades, then maybe
        this isn't a concern for you.
      </p>
      <p>
        The documentation is still a huge blessing, though, because Japan <i>is</i>
        one of those countries where the public has been made terrified of the
        consequences of sharing out-of-print documentation or software. This
        means basically any documentation you find online will be a secondary
        source that at one point had access to a primary source. Obviously,
        this is far from ideal for a hobbyist. But it's sometimes good enough.
        There are a few exceptions I've found on western sites like the
        Internet Archive, where I was able to find scans of documentation for
        my Logitec SCSI controller card.
      </p>
      <p>
        Drivers might be another huge road block. Until around 2016, it looks
        like you could still get a lot of documentation and drivers from
        Epson's site, but that seems to not be the case anymore. I was able to
        find drivers for my I-O Data graphics card on I-O Data's website, but
        this was the exception to the rule. And in that instance, there was no
        documentation available for download, so I had to look elsewhere to
        figure out what the DIP switches on it did.
      </p>

      <h3 id="pc9801_buying_wyatt_the_surprises">Surprises Upon Arrival</h3>
      <p>
        You can only prepare for so much. Not all sellers necessarily can be
        expected to think to or know how to open up the case of the PC, for
        example, or even do something basic, like taking a good picture of the
        back of the computer where all the cards and ports are (and where the
        model sticker usually is).
      </p>
      <p>
        In my case, there were several pleasant surprises inside.
      </p>
      <div class="imgcontain imgwrap" id="pc9801_buying_wyatt_surprise_486dx4">
        <a href="pc9801_1/full/surprise_boards.jpg">
          <img src="pc9801_1/surprise_boards.jpg"
               alt="My Epson PC-486GR with the case opened, showing extra RAM
                    board and CPU accelerator (486 DX4)"/>
        </a>
        <div class="imgwrap caption imgcentercaption">
          That blower fan is definitely not stock. The RAM card (right)
          isn't, either.
          <br/>
          I wasn't expecting any of these bonuses!
        </div>
      </div>
      <p>
        My PC-486GR was bought with a description basically equating to "it
        worked when it was stored a long time ago." No other details were
        given as to the particulars, and only exterior pictures were taken.
      </p>
      <p>
        When I opened it, there was more than anticipated to be happy about in
        there. Namely, the badge on the front plate of the computer (which
        is an Epson factory upgrade sticker proclaiming the presence of a 50MHz
        486DX2 inside) was a lie... in a pretty good way. It actually had a
        75MHz 486DX4 inside! Epson never offered a DX4 upgrade for this
        computer, from what I can tell; this accelerator board is from a
        company called "Asset Core" and it appears it may not have been
        marketed for very long. There are few pictures or bits of documentation
        of my specific accelerator on the web that I have been able to find.
      </p>
      <p>
        This makes it run a <i>wee</i> bit fast for some older titles, even on
        the slowest clock speed option. Removing the 486DX4 made my computer
        fall back to the 25MHz 486SX soldered to the CPU card, but I've not
        been able to find a jumper as of yet to allow me to more easily disable
        the DX4. If I could find one, I could attach the jumper to a toggle
        switch on the back of the case to easily switch between CPU's (at
        boot time). As it is, I'm considering looking for another 486GR just
        for that reason. -_-
      </p>
      <p>
        The CPU card additionally has both RAM slots filled. I think that
        supplies maybe 4 or 8 megabytes.
      </p>
      <p>
        There's also a Buffalo ERB-4000 RAM board in there; it has 4MB on-board
        and two empty slots that I could put sticks in if Epson-type RAM were
        not unobtainium.
      </p>
      <p>
        More generally, here's some things (a non-exhaustive list) to look for
        when you open your machine.
      </p>
      <h4>How much RAM?</h4>
      <p>
        The seller might not mention how much RAM it has. Hopefully, it has at
        least some, because PC-98 RAM (NEC PC-98 RAM) in general is not a
        standard pinout.
      </p>
      <p>
        For NEC-made computers, It can actually cause damage to the RAM and/or
        computer if you try to plug a standard JEDEC-compliant SIMM RAM stick
        into it (like the rest of the world used at the time), since the ground
        and power pins are not in the expected locations.
      </p>
      <p>
        The situation is a <i>little</i> better with the Epson models, where
        a JEDEC SIMM ram stick at least shares the same power pins, but JEDEC
        still won't <i>work</i> in an Epson due to different data and/or
        address lines.
      </p>
      <p>
        Unfortunately, <i>again</i>, Japan is xenophobic and only lets Japanese
        citizens get access to the National Diet Library, which is what
        <a href="http://98epjunk.shakunage.net/memory/make_ep_simm.html">
          at least least one person who wrote instructions on converting
          standard JEDEC RAM for use in Epsons</a> tells you to do.

        </div>
      </div>
      <p>
        On a side note, I would claim that allowing digital access to
        foreigners would only promote cross cultural understanding and cost the
        Japanese government next to nothing, since it is the ultimate arbiter
        of copyright law.  But everyone is seemingly terrified of copyright
        laws on decades-old newspapers and magazines. Not to say that copyright
        as a concept is inherently bad/wrong; that's another debate I don't
        want to get into (although it is fun to banter about). But I think it
        is inarguably harmful to us in this specific case, and the subject
        matter is no longer commercially relevant in the slightest and there
        aren't reprintings being made to sell, to my knowledge.
      </p>
      <p>
        Anyway, borders are dumb and arbitrary, promote an "us and them"
        mentality, and generally cause more harm than good. Thank you for
        coming to my TED talk.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b><i>SO, ANYWAY&hellip;</i></b>
      </p>
      <p>
        Back on topic, obviously I can't
        <i>&quot;just become Japanese, lol&quot;</i>
        and magically get legal access to that document without physically
        travelling across half the globe to the National Diet and then
        potentially having to yank a random Japanese citizen off the streets to
        get the paper on my behalf. So I'm not going to do that to get the
        pinout of some RAM.
      </p>
      <p>
        If anyone with access to a copy of pages 370 to 374 of the July 1997
        issue of <i>Transistor Technology</i> can summarise the details for
        me, though, you'd be doing the world a great service.
      </p>
      <p>
        Thankfully after hours of searching I was
        <a href="https://projectmps.net/simmepson.htm">able to find a pinout
          for Epson SIMM ram</a>. No thanks to that other person.
        Where was I going with this? - oh, right. <b>It's possible that someone
          took the RAM out of your PC.</b> I haven't seen this happen yet, but
        with a "junk" listing it'd be only too easy to do it and sell the RAM
        separately. Maybe if that's the case, you can modify a JEDEC stick to
        fit an Epson PC-98 clone by cutting traces and running wires.

      <h3 id="pc9801_buying_wyatt_expansion_cards">Expansion Cards</h3>
      <h4 id="pc9801_buying_wyatt_cards_hdd">Hard Drive Controllers</h4>
      <p>
        My PC does not have an IDE or SCSI controller built in, although some
        variants of it did come with one. There's an unused card edge slot in
        the case that can be hooked to a proprietary Epson card, which I
        believe uses SCSI and also houses a hard drive in a metal cage
        alongside it. I didn't see one on Yahoo Auctions, but did see that the
        cards have sold on there once in a while in the past. It might actually
        be a SASI card (pre-SCSI but basically compatible); I have read
        conflicting reports on that subject.
      </p>
      <p>
        The lack of that card is not a deal-breaker, because there's also
        C-Bus, which is the also-proprietary, but-at-least-publicly-documented
        slot NEC put on the PC-98 series for end-user expansions. C-Bus SCSI
        controllers exist and can be used to boot a hard drive, even on
        computers where a proprietary hard drive interface is also provided.
        Mine came with one, although I had trouble making it work. I have a
        feeling it was a termination issue, since it looks to only have
        passive termination on it.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you want to get a SCSI C-bus card, it seems that it would be best to
        get one that can be compatible with the <b>PC-9801-55</b> card (which
        appears to be is the 'standard' that most or all bootable SCSI
        controllers seem to mimic to some degree).
      </p>
      <p>
        There's a fair bit of configuration that many cards require to be done
        via DIP switches (if you can get a later era SCSI-2 card, you are more
        likely to be able to do software configuration than with older ones).
        I sort of understand this, since the main thing to do is ensure that
        no cards have overlapping addresses or interrupts, but sometimes the
        finer points elude me. It would be a good idea to take a picture of
        any cards you get before you start messing with the switches so you
        can restore to the configuration it came to you in.
      </p>
      <p>
        One interesting thing to note about these cards that I have not seen
        mentioned in the English speaking world yet is that the little plastic
        tab on some cards which presses a switch next to the slot to indicate
        that the card should be treated as a 24-bit addressable card instead of
        a 20-bit addressable one. If I understand correctly.
      </p>

          Note the plastic doohickey on two of these cards. This presses down a
          switch that is present in some PC-98 models.
        </div>
      </div>
      <p>
        Apparently some later 24-bit addressable cards don't have the button
        presser anymore, and some later 9821s don't have the switch installed
        on all slots but just assume a card is 24-bit addressable if it is
        present. I swapped a 'button presser' onto the card closest to the
        camera from the one in the middle and behavior did not seem to change,
        but the card closest to the camera did already have a spot for me to
        screw the lever thing into it, so it was clearly designed with the
        intent of using one at some point.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Don't peel those stickers off the brown chips, by the way.</b>
        Those cover up EPROM (Erasable Programmable Read-Only Memory) quartz
        windows, and if exposed to the right light frequencies (somewhere in
        the ultraviolet range) the chip will eventually be erased and the card
        won't operate properly. If you happen to have an EPROM programmer and
        the correct pin adapters, it'd be really great of you to dump the
        cards' ROMs and share them, too, because they could lose their data
        naturally even without light exposure at some point and need
        reprogramming. I sort of doubt the manufacturers care enough or even
        have the files (if they still exist) to help you out. Once the chips
        have lost their marbles, it's too late, unless someone's made a backup
        and can re-program them.
      </p>
      <p>
        I'll give a brief description of what some cards do, now.

        This card is the SCSI card I actually use with my system. I had to buy
        it separately; the PC did not come with this card from the previous
        owner. They had the TEAC IF-55TB installed, which I could not get to

        </a>
        <div class="imgwrap caption imgcentercaption">
          Both of my SCSI controllers have a 50 pin "mini centronics" connector
          like this.<br/>
          I see some Japanese people call it "half amphenol" as well, and
          Wikipedia calls it an 'HPCN50.'
        </div>
      </div>
      <p>
        It uses a "half-sized amphenol" (mini-centronics) connector, which is
        not a common SCSI connector here in the States but which seems to have
        been rather popular with Japanese manufacturers instead of the "HD50"
        miniaturized D-sub that most stuff seems to have used here. The
        LHA-301<b>A</b> uses a more common (in the west) HD50 connector, but I
        did not see one for sale, and after reading descriptions of various
        SCSI controller options online the 301 and 301A seemed like some of my
        best bets. They even support "PnP" ("plug-n-play") in Windows, and
        support up through Windows 2000. If I upgrade the BIOS ROM (not sure
        how exactly to do that) from 1.05 to 1.07, it seemingly can support up
        to 8GB SCSI drives. LHA-301 also supports three data transfer methods
        for interacting with the host system: PIO (the simplest, where the CPU
        is involved with every byte read in), DMA (direct memory access, which
        bypasses the CPU and writes directly to addresses in RAM so the CPU
        can work on other things), and SMIT (I have <i>absolutely no idea</i>
        what this is, but it seems to be the consensus of Japanese
        documentation I've found that it's faster than both DMA and PIO). I
        have mine configured for DMA right now and haven't had issues. I think
        there may be a DOS driver I need to install to actually make use of
        it, but I haven't done so, since I haven't felt too throttled by disk
        I/O yet and am just glad it's working so stably right now.
      </p>
      <p>
        I had to switch it out of "MO" (magneto-optical?) mode in order to make
        the DOS installer see and initialize it properly - I guess maybe a past
        owner was using it with a magneto-optical drive. The 130mm ones seem
        pretty cool. But I'm not getting one right now! - I've spent enough on
        this thing as it is!
      </p>
      <p>
        This card has a software-based configurator (accessed by holding
        ctrl+grph+L during boot) instead of DIP switches; I think it's really
        nifty. It also <i>actually works</i> for me (as opposed to the
        IF-55TB), which is also pretty nifty.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>One thing worth noting about the LHA-301 is that it doesn't seem to
          work with older, mechanical PC-98 keyboards</b> (like PC-9801V
        boards). I believe this is because the 9801V board requires the PC to
        send a "READY" signal to the keyboard before the board will send any
        key events to the host computer. Later boards apparently do not require
        this. <b>I could not even enter the configuration screen with the 9801V
          board, and had to switch to my rubber dome Epson to do so.</b> There is
        one generation of PC-9801 mechanical keyboard after the 9801V series,
        so I cannot confirm or deny if those work. The difference there is that
        the lock keys don't mechanically latch downwards ('alternate action')
        when engaged. They also have the extra 'function keys' that are lacking
        on the 9801V board. <b>There is a chance that these later mechanical
          keyboards will work,</b> but I can only guarantee that my 1992 rubber
        dome Epson board (and probably rubber dome NEC boards from around then
        onwards) can be used to configure the LHA-301.
      </p>
      <p>
        So, if you don't want to have two keyboards sitting around, you may
        need to avoid the LHA-301, accept that you will be using a mushy rubber
        dome board, or maybe try that final generation of mechanical boards
        with the extra function keys and non-latching lock keys.
      </p>
      <p>
        This is the only time I have found a problem with using the 9801V board
        - Everything else I have tried works fine with it. I'm just glad I
        already had successfully configured it with the Epson board, or I would
        have probably not recognized that the keyboard was the problem.
      </p>
      <p>
        From what I can see, the
        difference might be that the 55TB doesn't seem to have a voltage
        regulator on board, which is a prerequisite for active SCSI bus
        termination (the better kind). If I have an active terminator on one
        end and a passive resistor pack terminator on the other, that might
        explain why it behaves erratically.

        There's one thing it can't do, which is the PC-98's "Hi-Res"
        mode, which requires things to be at different addresses. I don't think
        this mode ever got much use, and later Windows-era machines had a
        different, incompatible solution for higher-resolution display. Since
        I don't know what I'd use it for, it doesn't bother me yet.

      <h4>Sound Cards</h4>
      <p>
        There are a few different kinds of sound cards available for the PC-98
        series. I currently only have a dead PC-9801-86 that needs new
        capacitors and a working MPU-PC98II; 26 sound is integrated into my
        PC's main board.
      </p>
      <p>
        <span id="pc9801_buying_wyatt_cards_sound_fm86"><b>86 Sound:</b></span><br/>
        If you are lucky, your system will already have a PC-9801-86
        compatible sound chip (YM2608, or OPNA), or even the full PC-9801-86
        C-Bus board installed. There are also a handful of clones of the
        PC-9801-86 that exist, but they don't seem especially common online.
        The -86 board is common, but also expensive. If you can, I'd suggest
        looking for a computer with a built-in "86 sound" chip. On With98
        (see <a href="#pc9801_buying_wyatt_links_japanese">links</a>),
        these are represented with something like "YM2608," "86 sound,"
        or mentions of PCM or ADPCM capability. I think it was introduced
        alongside the PC-9821 series, or perhaps very shortly thereafter.
        Most 9821 models should have it, I think.
      </p>
      <p>
        An "86 sound" compatible system will get you PCM audio support, which
        is a massive upgrade that allows for things like voice acting, or
        things like sound effects in Windows 3.1 (if you're into that).
        It also gets you stereo FM synthesis sound and PCM recording
        capabilities. In the long term, it's a nice thing to have.
      </p>
      <p>
        The 86 sound <b>card</b> (i.e., not integrated onto motherboard) has a
        single DE9 (often mistakenly called DB9) connector for a joystick using
        a variant/extension of the basic Atari (2600) joystick pinout. For at
        least one of the two fire buttons, it may be usable with a Sega Master
        System or a Mega Drive pad as well. To get multiple fire buttons
        working with non-MSX pads, some rewiring or adapters may be required.
        I talk about this more in the "joysticks" section, later down on the
        page.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you want both fire buttons to work on your joystick/gamepad, then
        it needs to rewire/map the second fire button to pin 7 (first one is on
        pin 6). It follows the "MSX" joystick pinout. Sega pads put the second
        fire button on pin 9, so you'll need to make an adapter or rewire the
        controller. I've made a adapters for some different kinds of
        joysticks: a modified TAC-2 joystick with two distinct fire buttons
        (fire 2 on pin 5, like the Comrex), a Comrex Commander joystick (fire
        2 on pin 5 from the factory), and some Sega gamepads (fire 2 on pin 9).
        You should also make <i>especially</i> sure when doing this that 5
        volts and ground (if present) are mapped correctly. See the
        <a href="pc9801_buying_wyatt_joystick">"Joysticks/Gamepads" section</a>
        for some more information on hooking joysticks up to a PC-98.
      </p>
      <p>
        You will likely need to disable your integrated 26 or 86 sound chip in
        your BIOS or with DIP switches for the one on the card to function.
      </p>
      <p><a href="#pc9801_buying_wyatt_toc">[Top]</a></p>
      <p>
        <span id="pc9801_buying_wyatt_cards_sound_fm26"><b>26 Sound:</b></span><br/>
        An earlier sound card, the PC-9801-26 (or PC-9801-26K), will get you
        mono FM synthesis sound and no PCM playback. It is based on the YM2203C
        OPN chip. My Epson PC-486GR has one of these integrated into it, as do
        many other early 90's and perhaps late 80's PC-98 models. If you're on
        a budget, be reassured that most games I have tried support it, and
        especially for the earlier DOS games (from the 80's) that I am most
        interested in it's all you will need. It does not however have PCM,
        and it is mono sound only.
      </p>
      <p>
        The PC-9801-26K has more clones available than the -86 seems to. It's
        also a fair deal cheaper to find a 26K card.
      </p>
      <p>
        It has <b>two</b> DE9 (often mistakenly called DB9) connectors for
        joysticks in the "Atari joystick" button configuration (actually, the
        MSX variant thereof). This means it can be partially used with Sega
        Master System pads, or possibly Mega Drive pads. If you make a wiring
        adapter, they can fully work with Sega controllers or any other
        'parallel type' western joystick. See the above "86 sound" section for
        a brief run-down on the wiring.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Integrated 26 sound computers may not have a joystick port.</b>
        Unlike with the "86 sound" integrated models, I am not sure if an
        adapter can be made to repurpose the mouse port on the 26 sound models.
        For this reason, even if you don't want 86 sound, you may still want to
        at least buy a 'dedicated' PC-9801-26 sound card, which is cheaper than
        an 86 by far. See the
        <a href="pc9801_buying_wyatt_joystick">"Joysticks/Gamepads" section</a>
        for some more information on hooking joysticks up to a PC-98 system.
      </p>
      <p>
        You will likely need to disable your integrated 26 sound chip in your
        BIOS or with DIP switches for the one on the card to function.

        <span id="pc9801_buying_wyatt_cards_sound_soundblaster"><b>Sound Blaster:</b></span><br/>
        There is a Sound Blaster card for the PC-98, using an OPL3 chip and
        very much analogous to the ISA sound blaster 16's in IBM compatibles. I
        don't have a clue what software uses it, but there you have it. It does
        exist. It also has IBM-style joystick connectors ("gameport
        connectors"). Neither I nor my friend currently have any of these
        cards.

        <span id="pc9801_buying_wyatt_cards_sound_midi"><b>MIDI:</b></span><br/>
        Some stuff, especially later in the PC-98's lifetime, seems to adopt
        MIDI sound. I am not aware of too many (if any) cards that perform
        on-board MIDI synthesis, so you will likely need an external
        synthesizer. One cheapish way to do that, once you have a MIDI card,
        would be to get a good quality USB MIDI adapter for a modern PC and
        run a software MIDI synth like timidity on it, and then connect
        a MIDI cable between the PC-98 and the modern PC. If you pick the
        right soundfont, that's enough to get you basically a Roland Sound
        Canvas. A lot of games use "GS" (Roland's General MIDI extension)
        or General MIDI instrument mappings, so that should get you a long way.
        Some games also use the Roland MT-32, which <b>is not</b> GS
        compatible. You could perhaps use MUNT (which emulates the MT-32 pretty
        well) for this, if you can legally obtain the ROM chips and dump them.
        That way, you just need to connect your PC-98 to a modern PC and have
        the modern PC perform the MIDI synthesis for you.
      </p>
      <p>
        You could also hunt down a physical Roland Sound Canvas (SC-55mkII
        and SC-88 seem to be popular options) for the GS games. For the MT-32,
        an actual MT-32 is ideal; a D-110 might also work, but the sounds will
        be different (arguably, the D-110 has better samples - but it will not
        represent what the games were actually designed to sound like, even if
        the instrument ID's mostly match up). The D-110 is also <i>huge</i> by
        comparison to an MT-32, since the D-110 is 19" rack mounted equipment.

        I just recently got a Roland SC-55K, which is based on the SC-55mkii
        but lacks a screen and most of the buttons of the actual SC-55mkii.
        It's a unit meant for karaoke, is Japan-exclusive, and is also
        basically an enhanced version of the SC-55ST. The 55ST, unlike the
        SC-55K, has no MIDI thru or MIDI out ports to speak of. So if you're
        choosing between a 55ST and a 55K, I'd suggest the 55K. It's just
        a 55ST, but with more I/O. For the non-Karaoke features, you can just
        use the SC-55ST manual for directions and it'll get you where you need
        to go, since the 55ST is a strict subset of the 55K's functionality.
      </p>
      <p>
        Don't be tempted into thinking you can just use your PC's serial port
        as a MIDI interface; most software doesn't seem to allow doing this,
        even though the 55mkII, 55ST, and 55K all support MIDI over RS232.
        Things really expect you to have an MPU interface, unfortunately for
        your wallet.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you get a 55ST or 55K, and your software <i>does</i> support MIDI
        over RS232 on a PC-98, you want to use the "PC-1" position for the
        switch on the back. The
        <a href="http://lib.roland.co.jp/support/jp/manuals/res/2209091700/SC-55K_j.pdf">55K's Japanese manual</a>
        says that the "PC-1" position is for the "PC-9800 series," whereas
        the
        <a href="http://cdn.roland.com/assets/media/pdf/SC-55ST_OM.pdf">English
          manual for the 55ST</a> omits that and just mentions in a note
        that "PC-1" is for a 31.25Kbps connection. Otherwise, it basically
        glosses over the existance of the "PC-1" setting and emphasizes the use
        of "PC-2" for IBM compatibles (PC/AT class).
      </p>
      <p>
        The SC-55 and family are GS MIDI synths; if a game asks you to choose
        between "GS" and some other sound formats (perhaps "26", "86", and
        "MT"), "GS" pretty much means the Sound Canvas series in this context.
      </p>
      <p>
        I've run my 55K with the original Roland 100V-in power brick
        straight from a wall outlet (around 120V) without issue, but I
        typically use my stepdown transformer to be safe. See
        <a href="#pc9801_buying_wyatt_power_converters">the relevant section</a>
        about powering Japanese domestic electronics.
      </p>
      <p>
        For the record, the SC-55K,and presumably the SC-55mkii, ask for
        a 9 volt DC, <b>tip/center-negative</b> power connection. This is the
        same as an MT-32, a Famicom, a Super Famicom/European SNES, or a Sega
        Master System, and almost the same as a Sega Genesis (<b>model I</b>
        only). So if you don't want/can't use a stepdown transformer, or
        weren't given the original power brick with your Japanese-imported
        unit, you can use any of the above power bricks as a substitute.
        The extra one volt or so of the Genesis power brick will be burned off
        as extra heat by the 7805 voltage regulator that the Sound Canvas uses.
        You could probably even use a 12v <b>center negative</b> brick and it'd
        work. If you encounter problems with this, the 12 volts might be
        overheating the regulator. Let it cool down and use a lower voltage
        brick.
      </p>
      <p>
        You can also get a new power brick for it; I've had luck with the
        Triad Magnetics
        <a href="https://catalog.triadmagnetics.com/item/wall-plug-in-transformers/wall-plug-ins-switch-mode-power-supplies/wsu090-1300-r">WSU090-1300-R</a>
        power adapter, which I've been buying through Digi-key. It can also be
        bought from Mouser - or even Console5, apparently. I typically don't
        use Console5, but maybe it's worth it if there's some other old game
        console stuff you need. I've only once bought something from it, and
        that was for making my own Wii S-Video cord.
      </p>
      <p>
        This isn't meant as a promotion for the Triad over any other supply;
        just as an easy option that is readily commercially available if
        someone doesn't want to do the legwork to figure out all the specs on
        their own. Anything that can deliver at least one watt at 9 volts
        DC, has a negative tip/positive shell polarity arrangement, uses an
        approximately 2.1mm x 5.5mm x 11mm plug, and accepts your local voltage
        as an input should work.
      </p>
      <p>
        Note that the '-R' at the end of the product model name is important.
        <b>The non-'-R' version of this supply is positive-tipped, and will
          quite possibly damage your hardware.</b> So if you're looking for one
        on other sites like eBay or Amazon, make sure it's the '-R' version.

        <span id="pc9801_buying_wyatt_midi_mt32"><b>Roland MT-32:</b></span><br/>
        I have also seen some software that supports the earlier Roland MT-32.
        Thankfully, I've had one of those for about five or six years now. I
        can't really recommend buying an MT-32 at today's market prices,
        though. I think there was a Raspberry Pi project I saw to emulate an
        MT-32 which looks much more affordable. And MUNT (the software MT-32
        emulator people use) is getting pretty good. The only inaccuracy I've
        noted (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kng3Rfn2tBk">I arrange
          music on my MT-32</a>) are that sometimes my real (early revision)
        MT-32 drops notes that MUNT will play correctly - I have never felt
        that something felt wrong due to this extra polyphony. My early
        revision MT-32 also can't handle system exclusive messages in rapid
        succession like later revisions of the hardware (or MUNT) can. So in a
        lot of ways, I'd argue, MUNT is actually better than the real thing.
      </p>
      <p>
        That won't make me stop loving my MT-32, but it is a reason that I
        don't think it's truly necessary to own one. If you can find a legal
        way to obtain the ROM chips, that should be enough. Maybe someone on
        ebay will sell the original chips harvested from dead hardware once in
        a while? I'd guess that that would count as owning a legitimate copy of
        the copyrighted information to make your own ROM dumps from. MUNT
        <i>does</i> require ROM dumps to work, unfortunately.
      </p>
      <p>
        The MT-32 uses the same power input as the Sound Canvas SC-55. Read
        the section on the Sound Canvas for more information.

        <span id="pc9801_buying_wyatt_midi_mpu401"><b>MPU Card:</b></span><br/>
        Just having a synthesizer isn't enough. You also need a way to connect
        it to your computer! On IBM compatibles, one would initially have used
        a Roland MPU-401 box with MIF-IPC or MIF-IPC-A (compatible with faster
        computers) ISA card. On a PC-98 series computer, this would be an
        MPU-401 box and Roland MIF-PC98 card.
      </p>
      <p>
        Later on, the MPU-401 was integrated into the interface card,
        eliminating the external box entirely. For an IBM compatible, this
        would be a Roland MPU-401AT ISA card; for the PC-98 there were the
        MPU-PC98 and MPU-PC98II cards. From what I gather (<b>this may easily
          be wrong</b>; this is information gathered from hearsay), the main
        difference between the MPU-PC98 and MPU-PC98II cards is that the 98II
        has DIP switches to change IRQ settings (a big deal!). Perhaps some
        bugs were also fixed; I can't find any concrete evidence on this front
        from a cursory search.
      </p>
      <p>
        I bought an MPU-PC98II interface, which lets me eliminate the need for
        an expensive external box and also lets me change IRQ's. It may be
        argued that given the simplicity of the interface cards and
        availability of brand new cards for interfacing with the external
        MPU-401 boxes, I should have bought that version instead so I could
        share a single MPU-401 with IBM-compatibles. That's a fair point,
        except that currently my only working IBM compatible with externally
        facing ISA slots is an AT&amp;T 6300 (8086-based) PC, which is quite
        a bit older than I'd want for music. My Pentium III Gateway has a
        single ISA slot, but it's not got an exposed bracket, strangely. And
        the Pentium III can probably(?) use MIDI out over a Sound Blaster Live!
        PCI card, anyway, which incorporates much of the MPU-401's
        functionality and cost me far less (as far as I can remember, it was
        free). I don't know if the "intelligent mode" of the MPU-401 is
        emulated there, though.
      </p>
      <p>
        The "intelligent mode" of the MPU-401 uses an 8 track sequencer,
        sync and metronome outputs, and possibly other things. The alternative
        is the simpler "UART mode," where the MPU-401 basically acts like a
        dumb 31250 baud serial port. I don't know that I've personally ever
        had trouble, but it's something other people on the internet always are
        warning people about regarding USB adapters with old synths like the
        MT-32. Maybe my USB adapter has that 'intelligent mode?' - It's the
        Roland UM-One. Some of the other USB adapters I've tried <i>are</i>
        prone to dropping notes. Maybe that's why. I'm out of my element here.
        It appears that emulators like DOSBox and Neko Project 2 Kai support
        MPU-401 emulation in software (and thus should be usable with a dumb UART
        USB adapter).
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm not aware of any hardware MPU cards that <i>don't</i> come from
        Roland for C-Bus, so maybe it's irrelevant to worry about intelligent
        mode MPU-401 support.

        And if you have a truly <i>enormous</i> sum of money, and you want
        to thank me for writing this, I of course wouldn't say no to being
        offered a little of it. ;)
      </p>
      <p>
        Of course, I also appreciate a written 'thank you,' even without
        monetary transactions. It's also a great motivator to keep writing
        if I know I'm helping people.

      <h3 id="pc9801_buying_wyatt_cards_irq">IRQ's</h3>
      <p>
        For the most part, using factory default settings, most stuff "just worked" for me.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, my LHA-301 card wanted to be on INT0 (IRQ 3). This is the same
        IRQ my PC-9801-86 card wants to use by default. I suspect this was at
        least part of why Touhou 4 and 5 would hang my computer. The final IRQ's
        I chose for all my parts are as follows. For the sake of providing more
        information, I have also included the other IRQ's (including internal
        ones that don't really have much to do with the C-Bus). C-Bus IRQ's
        should be any that have an associated interrupt number. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Basically, when you use expansion cards, your goal should be to not
        have any IRQ's overlapping between different bits of your hardware. So
        if your sound card is on IRQ 3 (INT0), you should make sure none of
        your other cards use IRQ3 (INT0).

        Note that the MPU-PC98II MIDI card defaults to using INT2, so I moved
        it to INT1 by changing a jumper. I discovered that Touhou 2 would not
        use my MIDI card otherwise, for some reason. I've seen some discussion
        online about how its MMD driver (its MIDI driver) has trouble/won't
        detect a MIDI card on IRQ #6. But for most other stuff, if you
        encounter weird issues - especially MIDI issues - try changing the
        interrupt back to INT2.

        At the risk of promoting FUD, I will point out/remind you that the
        Japanese power grid runs at 100 volts AC (at either 50 or 60 Hz).
        You shouldn't have to worry about frequency regardless of where you
        live, but if you aren't in Japan itself you <i>may</i> want to or
        need to invest in a step-down power transformer.        
      </p>
      <p>
        Japan's mains voltage is the lowest in the world, and it is the only
        country that uses this voltage. It just
        <b><i>might</i></b> be close enough to the US power grid's 110, 115,
        or 120 volts to work - seemingly, the number depends on who you ask,
        the specific year, and several other details. It seems that the
        standard in the US is now 120 volts, but that prior to sometime in the
        1970's most regions used 110 to 115 volts. Regardless, we now use 120
        volts, which is of course 20% higher than what the power supply in your
        PC-98 was designed and rated for use with.

      <h4>Side Tangent: Power Supply Math <a href="#pc9801_buying_wyatt_psu_tangent_end">(skip to end)</a></h4>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        Now, if you're familiar with how power supplies work, forgive me for
        going on this tangent, but in case you aren't, here's the gist of it,
        and the reason for why it <b><i>might</i></b> work, if you make a
        <b>lot</b> of assumptions about how the power supply is designed.
      </p>
      <p>
        Some terms related to power supplies to know about:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <i>Voltage Regulators</i>:<br/>
          Voltage regulators typically refer to a circuit that can convert a
          higher voltage to a lower one, where the voltage remains relatively
          steady even as current drawn might change. The two main classes are
          <i>linear</i> and <i>switching</i> regulators.
          <ul>
            <li>
              <i>Linear regulators</i> convert a higher voltage to a lower one
              by burning off the excess as heat. 
              <ul>
                <li>
                  These things get HOT. Just <i>how</i> hot they get is a
                  multiplicative product of <b>(1)</b> how many volts need to
                  be burned off and <b>(2)</b> how much current is used by
                  the stuff the regulator is powering.
                </li>
                <li>
                  For a frame of reference: the NES, Sega Mega Drive/Genesis,
                  and SNES all use linear regulators; the vast majority of the
                  heat generated by these sytems is from the regulators. I'd
                  go as far as to say the only reason the case even gets
                  <i>warm</i> is because of the regulator. And those are only
                  going from around 7-9 volts down to around 5 volts!
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      For this reason, trying to use a linear regulator to
                      directly turn about 100 volts into 5 volts is crazy.
                    </li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                  Commodore 64 and VIC-20 OEM power supplies (the super
                  heavy ones) also use a 7805 regulator internally as far
                  as I can tell - although it's sealed in a huge block of
                  epoxy. Ever notice how hot those power supplies get?
                  That's why.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Linear regulators are dead simple to use; I made a power
                  supply using one way back in 2012 or so.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              <i>Switching regulators</i> convert a higher voltage to a lower
              one through <i>Pulse Width Modulation</i> (or similar
              techniques).
              <ul>
                <li>
                  In PWM, by switching the full voltage on and off
                  super fast, the 'average' voltage comes out to something
                  lower than the maximum. This works because when power is
                  applied, it takes a small but quantifiable amount of time
                  for the full voltage to be applied. The voltage has to
                  rise or fall, which is not instantaneous.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Switching regulators burn far less energy as heat than a
                  linear regulator.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Switching regulators are perhaps trickier to design than
                  linear ones.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Switching regulators are typically 'noisier' than linear
                  ones; the switching on and off creates electromagnetic
                  interference patterns that are absent in linear regulators.
                  This can be largely mitigated, at additional expense.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Some notable things that used switching regulators are the
                  Apple II series computers, as well as most modern computers.
                  Many handheld electronics (such as the Game Boy, I believe)
                  also make use of them.
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      From what I can tell, I think the high pitched whine
                      that many game boys seem to make is caused in part by
                      the switching regulator. Or perhaps the horizontal scan
                      rate of the screen(?)
                    </li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          <i>Transformers</i>:<br/>
          Transformers are wire coils wrapped around a piece of
          typically ferrous material (such as iron, steel). Two such coils
          in proximity to each other can convert higher voltages at lower
          currents to lower voltages at higher currents, or lower
          voltages at higher currents to higher voltages at lower currents.
          <ul>
            <li>
              The ratio of input to output voltage is primarily determined by
              the number of windings on each coil in relation to the other.
            </li>
            <li>
              Compared to, say, a voltage regulator or charge pump, they are
              highly efficient at creating dramatic drops or increases in
              voltage (respectively).
            </li>
            <li>
              They <i>only work on alternating current sources.</i>
            </li>
            <li>
              The output voltage will change with input voltage (they are
              prone to fluctuations caused by the power grid). Regulators
              by comparison output a very reliable voltage.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          <i>Bridge Rectifier</i>:<br/>
          A bridge rectifier is a set of two to four diodes (which allow
          electricity to flow in one direction/polarity but not the other)
          that can be used to convert alternating current into a
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulsed_DC?useskin=monobook">"pulsed" direct current</a> output.
          <ul>
            <li>
              This pulsed DC is not a stable voltage, but sort of "bounces"
              down and up - unlike AC, however, it never drops below zero
              volts. AC by comparison is negative with respect to neutral
              half of the time).
            </li>
            <li>
              I will be talking about "full wave rectification" (see the wiki
              link above), although it probably won't matter much for our
              purposes.
            </li>
            <li>
              By putting a capacitor between the bridge rectifier's
              so-called "ground" output and its positive (or negative) voltage
              output, a much smoother signal (closer to normal direct current)
              can be achieved.
            </li>
            <li>
              Before semiconductors, we used rectifier vacuum tubes for a
              very similar purpose. But I don't know much more about those.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Now, based on those parts, maybe you can guess how an AC to DC
        power supply is typically put together for something like a computer.
        Just in case you don't quite see the picture yet, I can elaborate.
        Here's a (simplified) step-by-step of what happens in a power supply.
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Alternating current (AC) is fed into the power supply from the wall.
        </li>
        <li>
          A <i>transformer</i> (basically, a kind of wire coil) is used to
          bring the higher AC voltage down to a lower voltage, closer to
          what you are trying to supply power to.
          <ul>
            <li>
              For our purposes, let's say that we designed the transformer to
              take 100 volts AC in and output 10 volts AC (a 10-to-1 ratio of
              input to output voltage).
            </li>
            <li>
              Remember: this same transformer, assuming it was beefy enough to
              handle the heat and voltages involved, would (I think) also
              reduce other input voltages by the same ratio. If fed 220 volts,
              it would output 22. If fed 120 volts, it would output 12.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          The lowered AC power output from the transformer is fed into the
          bridge rectifier to turn it into (pulsed) direct current.
        </li>
        <li>
          The pulsed DC output gets one or more filter capacitors put between
          the two power rails (ground and positive) to smooth out the pulses
          into a less fluctuating, more conventional/constant direct current.
          <ul>
            <li>
              Typically, there is still a little 'wobbling'/fluctuation of voltage
              after this step.
            </li>
            <li>
              The smoothed DC is still prone to fluctuation based on changes in the
              input AC voltage, so we have to do one more thing to make it
              trustworthy.
            </li>
            <li>
              With our 100V input, 10V output transformer, the smoothed DC is
              probably about 8 or 9 volts, rather than 10 - the diodes in the
              rectifier dropped some of the voltage.

        <li>
          The smoothed DC is fed into a voltage regulator, which outputs a
          relatively constant/stable voltage, even under load.
          <ul>
            <li>
              Many voltage regulators have some minimum input voltage required
              to operate which is markedly higher than their desired output
              voltage.
              <ul>
                <li>
                  For this reason, shaving as close as possible to the
                  output voltage with the transformer itself without going
                  below your target isn't a viable answer; the output voltage
                  must be somewhat higher, which means that some amount of
                  heat is inevitable.

                <li>
                  The LM7805 is a very common linear regulator; it is used in
                  the Atari 2600, NES, Master System, Mega Drive/Genesis,
                  SNES, and probably loads of others. Many companies make
                  LM7805's or clones thereof, and their individual
                  specifications may vary slightly, but in general datasheets
                  seem to say you should supply at least 7 or 7.5 volts DC for
                  them to operate properly and output 5 volts DC.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        So, given that information, and given that we designed a power supply
        to turn 100 volts AC into 5 volts DC, let's imagine how the voltage
        would change as we go through the steps when inputting 100VAC:
      </p>
      <h4>100V AC -&gt; 5V DC (hypothetical) with 10:1 transformer</h4>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Transformer: 100V AC -&gt; 10V AC
        </li>
        <li>
          Bridge rectifier + smoothing capacitor: 10V AC -&gt; 8.6V DC (rectifier diodes drop some voltage, let's say 1.4V)
        </li>
        <li>
          7805 voltage regulator: 8.6V DC -&gt; 5V DC (difference of 3.6 volts)
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        Given an appropriate cooling solution, the 7805 can handle some rather
        large (10 volts or more) voltage drops; the main problem is adequate
        cooling. The two things that make a linear regulator run hotter are
        input voltage and output current; output current (we assume) is rather
        steady. So what happens if you increase the input voltage to 120V?
      </p>
      <h4>120V AC -&gt; 5V DC (hypothetical) with 10:1 transformer</h4>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Transformer: 120V AC -&gt; 12V AC
        </li>
        <li>
          Bridge rectifier + smoothing capacitor: 12V AC -&gt; 10.6V DC (rectifier diodes drop some voltage; let's say 1.4V)
        </li>
        <li>
          7805 voltage regulator: 10.6V DC -&gt; 5V DC (difference of 5.6 volts)
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        So, the 100V -&gt; 5V setup would (in this configuration) dissipate about
        3.6 watts with a 1.0 amp load (wattage = voltage &times; current). The
        120V one has a 5.6W drop; a difference of two watts. If I read the TI
        datasheet correctly, it seems like it expects a four degree celsius
        rise for a one amp increase, so perhaps it would run eight degrees
        celsius hotter? - this feels like a <b>massive</b> oversimplification.
        Someone who actually didn't flunk out of engineering school, please
        correct me!

        This <i>might</i> be fine, and if it is it would certainly save you
        some money if you live in a &lt;=120V country. But your computer's
        power supply would at a minimum run hotter than it was expected to
        by the engineers who designed it, and at worst have a reduced service
        life, overheat, or cause some somewhat low-rated filter capacitor to
        pop (remember that electrolytic capacitors often have huge margins of
        error on them on the magnitude of 20%). I'm guessing that a
        respectable company like NEC would not have used the bare minimum
        capacitor ratings, but these caps are still old unless you replace
        them, and a nice Japanese-made step-down transformer can be had for
        $100 or less to remove some of the nervousness that I would have
        plugging it in directly.
      </p>
      <p>
        I have successfully run a Roland SC-55K with its original Japanese
        100V rated power brick directly on US wall power, but I still am
        using it with a stepdown now - after I realized that I'd just been
        using an incorrectly specified Japanese domestic wall wart. You guys
        in Europe are kind of lucky, in a way: it'd be a <b>lot</b> harder to
        accidentally plug a Japanese power cord/brick directly into your wall.
        Here in the states, it is quite easy to do absentmindedly.
      </p>
      <p>
        I do recommend labelling your power cables on both ends - down by the
        plugs and up by where they plug into your equipment. I used blue
        painter's tape to make them stand out. This way, I am hopefully
        reminded that there is something special about the plug I'm holding if
        I ever need to rearrange the cables under my desk.
      </p>
      <p>
        If your PSU happens to have text on the back stating that it is rated
        for at least your voltage, then ignore everything I just said. But
        my Epson at least only specifies 100V at 50 or 60 Hz.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you are in Europe, you will almost certainly have to get a step-down
        transformer, unless there's some industrial PSU for PC-98's used
        with something like CNC machines that I'm unaware of and your
        machine came from somewhere like that rather than from Japan.
      </p>
      <p>
        I went a little pricier with mine and bought a used Sanyo TSD-N11LU
        transformer, with a nice "capacity indicator" and a rating of
        1100 Volt-Amps (not QUITE the same as saying 11 watts, in this case,
        apparently, but I don't know why that is. My guess is that it's
        something to do with how the transformer is actively changing the
        voltage and permissible current ) If your PC, monitor, and anything
        else Japanese that you are running off of your transformer totals less
        than the rated wattage, you should be fine. To be safe, I recommend
        going significantly higher than the minimum; things like hard drives
        draw a lot of power draw at spin-up, which might be fine for a short
        period of time, but I've seen stuff fail from excessive current draw
        when spinning up a bunch of disks before. I'd also just suggest trying
        not to stress your hardware, since it'll be expensive to ship. more of
        it if you break it - assuming you can even find exactly your computer
        or whatever it is you are trying to replace. It also provides
        future-proofing; part of my reason for going high was in case I ended
        up importing a CRT (which I did).
      </p>
      <p>
        If you can find an isolation transformer, that's especially nice, since
        while heavy it means you don't have to worry about earth grounding it
        at the wall outlet.
      </p>
      <h4>Accessories that Use AC Adapters</h4>
      <p>
        For accessories for your PC-98, if they use a DC barrel jack, you may
        be better off if you get a new wall wart that is simply correctly
        specced for your mains voltage and desired output/plug size. I
        mentioned the correct AC adapter for the Roland MT-32 and SC-55 above,
        for instance. This way, you don't have to worry about getting a power
        strip or similar for your stepdown transformer. Most of the good ones
        (non-Chinese) don't have a ground prong on their outlets, so most
        US spec power taps won't (safely) be able to cut it. You might have
        to import a Japanese strip, or use a US "cheater plug" with a wire
        strapped to that metal contact underneath that runs to a ground point
        on the stepdown transformer.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you want to get something new and of reasonably good quality, I'd
        suggest ordering on Digi-key or Mouser - or at least searching for part
        numbers by doing that and then buying what you find by narrowing down
        your search off of somewhere like ebay, or maybe your local hobby
        store, if your hobby shop will get stuff like that for you.
      </p>
      <p>
        If your stuff comes with the original AC adapter, you can probably use
        it with your step-down transformer as well.
      </p>
      <h4>Using western 120/240V accessories with a 100V PC</h4>
      <p>
        Perhaps it's just on account of poor quality electronics in the
        housing, but if I have my external SCSI hard drive housing switched on
        prior to turning on my Epson, the epson comes up with a "VR Failure"
        error (which I assume means "Voltage Regulator"). When using a ZuluSCSI
        board in the housing, I don't have to connect the 120V AC cable to the
        housing since it's powered by the SCSI controller's "TERMPWR"
        (Termination Power). Doing this, I can sidestep the error. I can also
        simply turn on the PC prior to flipping on the power switch on the
        housing and then press reset on the PC, and that also works.
      </p>
      <p>
        Why does this happen? I honestly don't know. I suspect it has something to do
        with the two devices not sharing a common earth ground, perhaps. Or
        maybe the power supply design inside my drive housing is of
        questionable quality? It's not a name branded thing, so that wouldn't
        be <i>entirely</i> surprising to me. But the output voltages are pretty
        much on the dot (checked with my Fluke 77 multimeter).
      </p>
      <p>
        Obviously, <i>something</i> weird is going on, so if you come across
        problems like this, I'd suggest trying to avoid using those
        accessories, but I've yet to find that I've actually hurt anything by
        doing this. Maybe it's just that the disk drive is trying to provide
        termination power and that's messing something up with the power supply
        to the C-bus cards? It might not be 120V related at all.
      </p>
      <p>
        In general, I think you'll probably be fine to use your domestic stuff
        with it, as long as nothing has a hot chassis (you have bigger problems
        if you have stuff with metal casing that does this; I don't think
        anything you'd want to use with a PC-98 would have a hot chassis
        construction, so it's not something to worry about). It can be a good
        way to save some money, if you can find domestic printers, scanners,
        serial terminals, external CD drives/external hard drives, and so on.
      </p>
      <p>
        &hellip;Actually, my modern desktop PC (which runs on 120V) is hooked
        to my PC-98 via a null modem serial cable, and it doesn't give a
        voltage regulator error message, so it's probably just some peculiarity
        of my SCSI controller or drive housing or configuration.

      <h3 id="pc9801_buying_wyatt_mouse">Mouse</h3>
      <p>
        Did your PC come with a mouse? If not, you need to get one for a lot of
        newer software.
      </p>
      <p>
        First off, you can't use a serial mouse. Well, maybe you <i>can</i>,
        at least in Windows, but if you are trying to run DOS programs I don't
        know if there's any TSR or similar software to make a serial mouse
        work. I also would expect that even if there is some workaround like
        this (akin to CTMOUSE/Cutemouse in western DOS), no DOS programs for
        the PC-98 are going to be programmed with such drivers in mind and
        may cause resource conflicts. Basically, I wouldn't even try, and
        consider it a bad idea, given the relative ease with which you can
        get a fully-compatible mouse.
      </p>
      <p>
        What you <i>actually</i> need to look for is commonly termed a
        "bus mouse." These mouses just send raw signals from the optical
        gate sensors on the X and Y axis rollers of a ball mouse over a
        wire back to the host computer, with no encoding like PS/2 mouses use.
        Pinouts varied, so not <i>all</i> things that could be arguably termed
        "bus mouses" will work, but anything made for IBM PC's probably will.
      </p>
      <p>
        The term "bus mouse" refers to the fact that early PC's had no built
        in mouse port, and so the user had to get or make an ISA card and link
        the mouse up to the computer's ISA bus. When used outside of an IBM
        context, these mouses typically seem to be called something like
        "quadrature mouses" instead. The terms are largely interchangeable.
        Quadrature is a word to describe the four signals that a mouse will
        send out for ball movement (two infrared light sensors per axis).
      </p>
      <p>
        Here's the run down on the things you might need.
      </p>
      <h4>Mouse Card (Older Systems Only)</h4>
      <p>
        Older PC-98's might not have a mouse port, and for those you'd need
        to find a "bus mouse" card, I believe. This only applies to the ones
        made before around 1985. <a href="https://radioc.web.fc2.com/column/pc98bas/pc98kbdmouse_en.htm">
          This site</a> claims the PC-9801, the 9801E, 9801F, and 9801M models
        are the ones that need a mouse card. I don't have a PC-98 that old, so
        I haven't looked too hard, but I did not see any mouse controller cards
        with a cursory search when I tried. They're out there, but they might
        be somewhat uncommon. I'd expect that the early "green eyed" microsoft
        mouses came with cards, so maybe look for those? - Obviously, you'll
        need the C-bus version (not the ISA version the US and other countries
        got). It might be ASCII or NEC branded instead of Microsoft.
      </p>
      <p>
        You should note that most software that requires a mouse is probably
        new enough to need EGC, so these early PC-98 models will be pretty
        much useless in that capacity. The main reason to get a card would
        be for historical interest, I'd expect.
      </p>
      <p>
        These early C-Bus mouse cards should use the 9-pin D-Subminiature
        connector as described in the following section. You can of course make
        an adapter to use the mini-DIN variant connector with one. I have
        reason to believe that the IBM-compatible version of the Microsoft
        "green eyed" mouse used the same connector, so if you get a card
        without a mouse, that might be an option for you that will save on
        shipping... but I see that someone recently bought one for $80 on ebay
        without a card, so it may be a smarter idea to just import some other
        PC-98 mouse from Japan or make an adapter (see the following section).
      </p>
      <p>
        I've seen at least one NEC ad featuring the green eyed mouse, so it
        <i>could</i> be a period-correct part for an early PC-9801 model that
        needs a separate mouse card, if you're going for originality. Actually,
        it looks to me from a search like the model number for the original
        mouse bundle might be NEC's "<b>PC-9871</b>." It seems to include a
        Microsoft green eyed mouse. There were maybe other mouse interface
        boards released later&hellip; but the PC-9872R seems to be <i>just</i>
        a DE9 mouse without a card. So maybe not. The mouse port was integrated
        pretty early on; it seems like the only models that need a card are
        probably the original PC-9801, the 9801E* 9801F*, and 9801M* series.
        Later ones seem to have an integrated port. You should check that
        yourself before you take my word for it, but I believe this statement
        to be accurate.
      </p>
      <h4>Two Mouse Connectors</h4>
      <p>
        For later machines, you will probably have one of two possible
        connectors. The choices are a 9-pin D-Subminiature connector or a 9-pin
        mini-DIN connector. If you have the mini-DIN, it's the same pinout as a
        "Microsoft InPort" bus mouse for the US market, which is for mouses
        that connect via an ISA card. For this reason, searching ebay for
        a PC "bus mouse" can get you something electrically compatible with a
        PC-98. Just make sure it's not Apple Desktop Bus (a different thing
        entirely). If it uses the D-Sub connector, you will need to make or get
        an adapter. I think the adapter will have to come from Japan, since
        the only western-market mouses that seems to <i>possibly</i> share this
        pinout are
        <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20010802062315id_/https://www.cs.rochester.edu/~kparkins/pinouts.txt">
          the original Microsoft "Green Eyed" bus mouse and perhaps a handful of
          Logitech ones</a>. I am not sure if passive adapters for connecting
        newer bus mouses to these older cards were ever widespread in the west,
        since we seem to have moved away from them far sooner than they did in
        Japan.

          The two common PC-9801 mouse pinouts. Seemingly, these are shared

          DE9 connector.
        </div>
      </div>
      <p>
        It would sort of make sense if the pinout and D-sub connector were
        chosen to match Microsoft's original mouse pinout, since NEC seemed to
        cooperate pretty closely with ASCII Corporation (ASCII was basically
        Microsoft's Japanese arm). I have found evidence that a PC-9801 version
        of the "green eyed mouse" exists, and that there was a C-bus mouse
        controller card for it, too.

        You could try to rewire an Amiga or Atari ST or AT&amp;T
        6300 mouse (or other two-or-more-button quadrature mouse) and
        have it work. You could also
        <a href="http://oldcomputer.info/hacks/mouse/index.htm">try this guy's
          "universal bus mouse" idea,</a> and convert probably just about any old
        PS/2 ball mouse you might own into a bus mouse. Probably some early-ish
        optical PS/2 or USB ones, too, since some of those just imitated the
        quadrature signals from their sensor IC's so they could be used with
        existing PS/2 interface/controller chips as a drop-in upgrade for ball
        mouse designs.
      </p>
      <p>
        I opted to buy a mini-DIN mouse, the Logitech PC-93-9MD, from someone
        in Texas and then ordered a mouse adapter from Japan, since I was in
        no hurry but my particular PC-98 has a D-sub mouse connector. I also
        decided I didn't want to wire up my own this time, since making
        something both small and durable is tough, and the cost of shipping
        parts from Digikey is almost as bad as just buying a used adapter from
        halfway across the planet unless you have other things you're buying at
        the same time.
      </p>
      <p> 
        Does that defeat the point of buying a mouse domestically...?
      </p>
      <p>
        Well, maybe.
      </p>
      <p>
        But the price of PC-98 mouse from Japan was nearly as much as the Texas
        mouse, even without shipping fees. So I think I may have come out ahead
        just due to how small of an envelope the mouse adapter could fit in.
        And this mouse had one more button than most of the Japanese ones! -
        although I'm not sure what all will use it.
      </p>
      <p>
        I swapped the extremely light weight ball that the mouse came with from
        Logitech for a much heavier one from a Microsoft two button serial
        mouse. The mouse worked fine before, but I feel like it's been much
        more reliable now that I put a heavier ball into it. Maybe it makes
        it need cleaning less often because the ball is less prone to sticking?

        With pin adapters you can also use a PC98 mouse with other computers
        that use bus style mouse interfaces like Amigas and Ataris. Pretty
        handy.
      </p>
      <h4>Adapting a Newer or Incompatible-Protocol Ball Mouse</h4>
      <p>
        You can also take almost any other ball mouse out there and with some
        major modifications convert it into a bus mouse. Check out
        "<a href="http://oldcomputer.info/hacks/mouse/index.htm">MCbx Old
          Computer Collection: Universal Mouse</a>" for the basic steps. The
        real thing to remember is that almost all ball mouses have quadrature
        signals internally, they just convert them before they leave the casing
        usually. So if you bypass most of the hardware and add an appropriate
        amplifier/buffer for the tiny signals, you can make your own bus mouse
        out of any ball mouse.
      </p>
      <p>
        Some optical ones also output quadrature signals
        to stay compatible with older PS/2 mouse interfaces during the
        transitionary stage between ball mouses and optical ones, so some of
        those earlier (not 80s early, maybe, but late 90s/early 2000's early)
        optical mouses can apparently be used, too.

      <h3 id="pc9801_buying_wyatt_joystick">Joysticks/Gamepads</h3>
      <p>
        There are a couple of kinds of joysticks for PC-98's. There's a Sound
        Blaster card out there that has what appears to be an IBM-style
        "Gameport" on-board. I don't know what all uses this, and don't have
        one of these cards.
      </p>
      <p>
        Another kind worth a mention connects via the keyboard port, sharing
        the bus with your actual keyboard, and can imitate keyboard key
        presses. These are usually programmable so you can bind keys to buttons
        for different games. They should be compatible with anything that uses
        a keyboard for input, even when the joystick port doesn't work. Touhou
        and Touhou II, for instance, should be playable with one of these.
        Unfortunately, I have not gotten one yet, and I've heard the one kind I
        know about has slight input lag.
      </p>
      <p>
        The third kind, which I <i>think</i> is most common and widely
        supported, is the Atari-derived digital variant. This is what the
        PC-9801-86 and PC-9801-26 sound cards use for their joystick ports, and
        the one(s) on the PC-98 use the MSX style expansion of the basic
        Atari joystick pseudo-standard - adding a second fire button on pin 7.

               two Commanders and one TAC-2 in this photo."/>

        <div class="imgwrap caption imgcentercaption">
          A sampling of my favorite joysticks (which use an Atari-style
          pinout).<br/>
          The Suncom TAC-2 is rather famous in some circles; the Comrex
          Commander seems relatively unknown. I love them both for different
          reasons.
        </div>
      </div>
      <p>
        I stole the coiled cable from a <i>third</i> (sort of unreliable)
        Comrex Commander for my TAC-2, actually, since I rewired it internally
        to be able to use both buttons as unique inputs - and the Comrex
        (unlike the TAC-2) supports the use of its buttons as unique inputs out
        of the box (and thus it has a cable that can be used to carry the extra
        signal to the computer/console).
      </p>
      <p>
        Also note that some joysticks with multiple buttons (at least in the
        west) would wire multiple fire buttons in parallel to one pin on the
        cord, meaning that they all act as the same button. Internal rewiring
        and new cables may be required to fix this on such a joystick. One that
        does this which is quite popular/famous is the Suncom TAC-2.

        Here's an adapter diagram. It took me over an hour to draw to make
        it look all pretty. Hand drew all of the smaller text in the picture

          If your system supports it, you can use an MSX compatible joystick by
          connecting this adapter to the mouse port.<br/>
          I think all PC-9821's with an 86 sound source built in will work.
          Don't plug it in backwards!!!!

        "26 sound". I think the only solution on computers in my situation is
        to get a dedicated "86 sound" compatible card - probably a PC-9801-86.
        You could maybe also get one of a handful of clones that never seem to
        show up for sale but purportedly exist. I looked for those first in the
        hopes that they would be cheaper - no cigar. But maybe <i>you</i> will
        have better luck!

      <p>
        A PC-9801-26K or similar older card with a 2203 that featured joystick

        had on your board anyway.

      <h4>Picking a Joystick/Gamepad</h4>
      <p>
        Generally, with joysticks, there are a few things to keep in mind when
        buying. These have to do with the things that <i>you</i> think of when
        you imagine your ideal joystick.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Ergonomics (Form Factor, Button Layout)
          <ul>
            <li>
              Gamepad or joystick? - the answer might be "both," for all I know.
            </li>
            <li>
              Handheld, desktop, or some kind of hybrid?
            </li>
            <li>
              How does it fit in your hand?
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Responsiveness
          <ul>
            <li>
              How far does the stick or d-pad move?
            </li>
            <li>
              Tightness - do you like a tight stick that resists all movement,
              or do you like a little wiggle room when in 'neutral?'
            </li>
            <li>
              How far should the stick have to travel for an input to be registered?
            </li>
            <li>
              How do diagonals feel? Is it easy to accidentally move diagonally
              when trying to move in a cardinal direction? Or is it perhaps
              annoying to actually use diagonals due to the extreme travel
              required for a diagonal to register?
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Feedback (Tactility/Feel)
          <ul>
            <li>
              To click or not to click? - I personally like it when I can hear
              that a switch in a joystick has activated.
            </li>
            <li>
              Haptic feedback - this may or may not be tied to 'clickiness,'
              depending on how the click is generated and how the switch
              mechanism is designed. If a joystick has rubber domes underneath
              it, you may feel a haptic/tactile bump but not get much auditory
              feedback.
            </li>

        <li>Reliability
          <ul>

            <li>
              How do the controller's parts age? What are problem spots to look out for?
            </li>
            <li>
              What kind of switch or sensing mechanism does the controller use?
              - not all switches are created equal; some seem to fare the
              years much better than others. Some are very sensitive to dust,
              humidity, or any number of other factors.
            </li>
            <li>
              How often does it need maintenance in normal use?
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Repairability
          <ul>
            <li>
              Materials - Brittle plastic? Good plastic? Metal? What are the
              parts made of?
            </li>
            <li>
              Parts availability/procurement - can you still <i>get</i>
              or <i>make</i> the parts to fix the stick if or when it breaks?
            </li>
            <li>
              If most of the ones that are available are broken, how much
              trouble is fixing them going to be? - Assuming you really like
              the other characteristics of the controller enough to do your own
              repair work.
            </li>
            <li>
              Do you have the tools and knowledge to fix it, or the
              means/willpower to acquire said tools and knowledge?
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Availability
          <ul>
            <li>
              Is it still being manufactured?
            </li>
            <li>
              If it is being manufactured, is the currently manufactured
              version still readily compatible with older systems?
              <ul>
                <li>
                  As an example, "Speedlink" seems to make a new version of the
                  "Competition Pro" joystick, for example but stupidly it only
                  sells it with a USB interface. So if you want to use it with
                  vintage hardware, I'd guess you'd need to take it apart, gut
                  the thing, get a correct cable, and rewire it yourself to
                  bypass the USB controller. So you may just be better off
                  getting a vintage one, maybe.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Neither of my two favorite sticks are currently in

      <h4>My Recommended Joysticks/Gamepads</h4>
      <p>
        I can't help with <i>all</i> of these criteria, but what I can do is
        tell you what <i>I personally</i> value in a joystick, and maybe show
        you my favorites.
      </p>
      <p>
        Want a joystick or controller, but aren't sure which ones are good, and
        don't know where to even begin with that list? - I'm no expert, but I
        at least can give you a <i>few</i> very good options. I firmly believe
        the sticks I discuss here to be good (at least when in good condition);
        I mainly claim not to be an expert because there are many joysticks I
        likely have never seen or heard of which might actually be quite good
        as well. Ultimately, it's subjective, and it's up to you to decide what
        you like in a joystick or gamepad.

      <h3 id="pc9801_buying_wyatt_monitor">Monitor</h3>
      <p>
        Your PC monitor may or may not work with the PC-98, as I have already
        alluded to. Its VGA connector almost certainly will not fit into the
        output on the PC-98, even if it is electrically compatible. Here is
        a drawing I made that corresponds to the adapters that I wired for
        myself and my friend.
      </p>
      <div class="imgcontain imgwrap" id="pc9801_buying_wyatt_vga_adapter_img">
        <a href="pc9801_1/vga_adapter.png">
          <img src="pc9801_1/vga_adapter_300.png"
               alt="(Picture of a Logitech PC-93-9MD mouse.)"/>
        </a>
        <div class="imgwrap caption imgcentercaption">
          This is drawn as if the two connectors' solder sides are facing each
          other, wide side up. The physical wiring will look pretty similar in
          this situation.
        </div>
      </div>
      <p>
        I am not 100% sure the ground wiring is all correct, so if you get
        noise definitely look first at pins 12 and 8 on the DA15 side and
        pins 5 and 10 on the VGA side. Perhaps I need to separate them from
        each other?
      </p>
      <p>
        According to the VGA pinout on Wikipedia, pin 5 on the VGA connector
        is supposed to be the ground specifically for the HSync signal, and
        pin 10 for the VSync signal. So if you can figure out which is which
        on the DA15 (PC-98) side (if any), then perhaps that will reduce noise.
      </p>
      <p>
        It looks fine on my CRT, though, which is why I have not bothered to
        mess with it much. I followed the DA15 pinout from
        <a href="https://radioc.web.fc2.com/column/pc98bas/pc98dispout2_en.htm">here</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Of course, there's also a solid chance your monitor will not be able to
        sync to the PC-98's 24KHz mode. If yours is like this, but you happen to
        have one that can sync to 15KHz (like my Commodore 1942 CRT or my Dell
        U2410 LCD), you can see if there's a DIP switch to make it output at
        15KHz. On my Epson, this switch exists on the front panel and is
        labelled <b>"HS24K."</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        When I first got this Epson, I had not yet bought a CRT and was hoping
        my LCD would do the job. Since 24KHz is in between 15KHz and 31KHz, I
        was a little hopeful, and I wired up my adapter while I waited for it
        to arrive.
      </p>
      <p>
        When it got here, I got nothing. But I was able to confirm operation by
        switching that DIP switch on the front panel, which made it show up on
        the Dell. I don't recommend just leaving it there, because a lot of
        stuff will break or work weirdly. It's not really a tenable long-term
        solution. Also, it introduces "scaling artifacts" such as uneven pixel
        widths, and most stuff that uses the higher color modes will be cut off
        halfway down the screen.
      </p>
      <p>
        Anyway, that happened, so I needed to get a CRT or a scaler (or another
        LCD). I ended up going for a CRT.
      </p>
      <p>
        Unfortunately, not all PC-98 monitors can sync at 24KHz either. Some of
        the later Windows 9821 monitors will <i>not</i> and run at 480p minimum
        (around 31Khz).
      </p>
      <p>
        Many if not all Sharp X68000 screens will also do 24KHz and can be
        used, by the way. The X68000 appears to use a compatible connector,
        too. Not sure about FM Towns, though. That's something that might be
        worth researching.
      </p>
      <p>
        Make sure the monitor you are looking for has <b>analogue RGB</b>, not
        just digital. Many older monitors have only digital RGB, which will
        limit the number of colors and types of software you can use.
      </p>
      <p>
        Additionally, finding a nicely priced one will be challenging, and you
        probably <b>will</b> get murdered on shipping. I won mine in an auction
        for $30 and paid <b>nearly ten times that much in shipping</b>, which
        was an unexpected surprise to say the least. I'd thought it'd be maybe
        $150 or so to ship. Apparently, Buyee re-packs stuff after inspection
        if you choose to have them inspect it, so I am nearly certain that
        Buyee's packaging is the reason it cost so much. For that reason,
        I am considering Buyee alternatives in the future, but we'll see.
        It did at least arrive very well protected and intact. But for a
        monitor that I bought 'untested' looking absolutely <i>filthy</i>,
        I don't know if I would have spent that much more in shipping had
        I been given a choice to not repack it.
      </p>
      <p>
        Unfortunately, my friend had already snagged what seems to have been
        the only really nice monitor at a fair price on the site, so I was left
        to deal with either super overpriced stuff or stuff that wasn't
        guaranteed to actually work, or overpriced stuff that I would
        definitely have to repair.

        I ended up deciding this filthy thing, an NEC PC-KD851 monitor, was my
        best bet for getting something that worked, since the seller said the
        screen would go bright when turned on or off. I operated under the
        principle that filthy untested stuff is more likely to be fine than
        spotless stuff that's tested and that the seller thinks is broken.
      </p>
      <p>
        To be honest, most stuff I pick up tends to be fine, and it probably
        wouldn't have been kept around long enough to get so filthy if it
        hadn't worked back in the day when it was presumably stored away.
      </p>
      <p>
        The thing came, and it took <b>hours</b> of scrubbing at it with a
        damp or alcohol-soaked rag to get most of the grime off. But it
        cleaned up pretty nicely!

        The PC-KD851 was originally made for the PC-8801 series, it seems,
        rather than the 9801. Specifically, I've found a catalog scan that
        says it works with the PC-8801mkIISR, which indicates it's from around
        1985. But since it has an analogue RGB input, and since the 8801 also
        could output at 24KHz, I decided it had a good chance of being
        compatible. I think the seller also listed it as being PC-9801
        compatible, actually.
      </p>
      <p>
        The PC-KD861 appears to simply be a better version of the 851 that can
        also do 15 KHz. So I'd say that'd be one worth keeping an eye out for.
      </p>
      <p>
        Once again, this needed to be plugged into a stepdown transformer
        before I felt comfortable turning it on. Thankfully there's an outlet
        on the back of the Epson that I can use to daisy-chain it.

      <h4 id="pc9801_buying_wyatt_ossc">OSSC - Open Source Scan Converter</h4>
      <p>
        Another approach is to use an existing western monitor that can't do
        24KHz natively by using an external digital video scaler that
        <i>can</i> handle it. I used an OSSC version 1.6, which is now an
        older version of OSSC but which seems to work fine. Tested on my Dell
        U2410 monitor. If it will support 56.4 Hz video or so, it should be
        fine.
      </p>
      <p>
        You will <b>need</b> to find a remote for your OSSC if you get one -
        most functions and configuration cannot be done with the on-board
        buttons. it's good to note that it doesn't need to be the remote that
        was originally shipped with it. If you hold down the rightmost button
        (closest to the LCD) on the front of the scaler unit while switching
        it on, you can program it to use the codes from some other remote
        control that outputs "NEC Protocol" infrared codes. Examples of some
        remotes I have that work with it include my Pioneer A/V receiver and
        laserdisc player remote controls, as well as my ancient Sony universal
        remote. You could probably even use a Game Boy Color or an
        HP-28C/28S/48S/48SX/48G/48GX calculator with the appropriate software,
        since both of those have infrared LED's that are software
        controllable! - I don't actually know what the range of the HP-48
        series transmitter LED is, though.
      </p>
      <p>
        OSSC's ship with remotes, so if you buy one new this is not an issue.
        You can buy the remote in question from third party sellers, but don't
        bother getting one pre-programmed for the OSSC specifically unless the
        price is really good. If you want to get one that is dedicated for the
        OSSC and has enough buttons to send all the controls it can use, then
        you can get an "L336" learning remote control and send it codes from
        some other programmable remote control that is set up for a device
        you don't have. Maybe using multiple device settings if you run out
        of buttons on the first one.
      </p>
      <p>
        To program the L336, you should first hold the button for the 'output'
        you want to program a key on - so the 'TV' button for instance. When
        the light comes on on the remote, aim your other remote control at the
        L336 and press the button code you want the L336 to be able to send.
        Repeat as necessary for all buttons you need. I also suggest that
        you get or print a label/overlay for the L336 to remind you which
        buttons do what. It really is helpful if you are trying to fine-tune
        something. You will probably need to do a little fine-tuning to make
        a PC-98 look just right on your LCD.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>I vastly prefer the look of the video output on my CRT;</b> it just
        feels better to me. But the costs involved can be vicious, and a CRT
        monitor unfortunately takes up a solid chunk of space&hellip; even for
        a small screen. The picture quality from my OSSC is good; any
        screenshot you see in my post here is originally fed through my VGA
        splitter, then OSSC, and eventually into my HDMI capture USB.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        The optimal settings I have found for my OSSC so far, for the output
        from my 486GR, were discovered by running "MPS" (Multi Paint System
        or Maguro Paint System/Tuna Paint) and drawing a red line around the
        permimeter of the screen to determine horizontal and vertical
        back porch &amp; front porch settings.

        Then I filled the whole screen with black and adjusted the black
        levels (red, green, and blue offsets, or "brightness"). I did this
        until a colour picker on my computer that was showing a picture from
        HDMI capture of the OSSC was showing numerically close RGB values for
        &lt;1,0,0&gt;, &lt;0,1,0&lt;, and &lt;0,0,1&gt;. Since RGB values are
        between zero and 15 on the PC-98, a 24-bit PC RGB value would be
        &lt;16,0,0&gt;, &lt;0,16,0&gt;, and &lt;0,0,16&gt; respectively. But I
        just got somewhere close to that and said, "that's good."
      </p>
      <p>
        For "white levels" (red, green, and blue gain, or "contrast"), I brought
        the gain controls down until RGB &lt;15,15,15&gt; was just barely
        reaching or very close to reaching PC RGB &lt;255,255,255&gt; - so that
        bringing any given one of the sub-colors down by one on the PC-98 would
        drop the brightness proportionately on PC RGB. This is to avoid
        "overexposing," or clipping the highlights.

      <h3 id="pc9801_buying_wyatt_hdd">Getting a Hard Drive</h3>
      <p>
        If your PC-98 or compatible doesn't come with a hard drive, then you
        might need a SCSI controller.
      </p>
      <p>
        You might also need a parallel SCSI drive; these are getting tougher
        to find at good prices. A good long term solution might be to get
        something like a SCSI2SD, BlueSCSI, or ZuluSCSI board that can emulate
        one or multiple SCSI hard drives.
      </p>
      <p>
        I happen to have a 4GB Seagate Barracuda from 1996 that still works,
        but I also took this opportunity to get a ZuluSCSI board. I don't know
        how durable the SD cards will be, but they're a bit easier to get
        replacements for than nearly 30 year old HDD platters or bearings or
        spindle motors for sure.
      </p>
      <p>
        I stuck my ZuluSCSI board in an old external HDD enclosure to make it
        feel more period correct, even if it's much, much quieter. I think I'll
        use my Seagate as well, but I'm just not sure how often.

      <h3 id="pc9801_buying_wyatt_odd">Getting an Optical Drive</h3>
      <p>
        If you want to transfer files via CD, or play or install something
        distributed on CD, you may need to get a drive if your PC-98 doesn't
        have one. Much like hard drives, your main options (depending on your
        model of computer) are IDE drives and SCSI drives, as far as CD's are
        concerned. PC-9821's often (perhaps always ) came with IDE
        controllers; 9801's and Epsons didn't (although I think some of the
        last Epson 98's did; seemingly the models introduced in or after
        September 1993 have an IDE interface built in, so the PC-486H* and
        PC-486F* models; 486G* and 486S* models and earlier do not).
      </p>
      <p><a href="#pc9801_buying_wyatt_toc">[Top]</a></p>
      <h4 id="pc9801_buying_wyatt_odd_ide">IDE Drives</h4>
      <p>
        Some later PC-98 models came with built-in IDE CD-ROM drives.
        If yours doesn't have one, but is late enough to be using
        IDE instead of SCSI, then there's a decent chance one might be
        able to be installed in an open bay, I'd think. In the Ce2 and
        Cs2, it looks like the model is NEC CDR-260. They seem to have sold
        these drives in the 'States, so maybe you can remove the front bezel
        from one of the US-market ones and stick it in a '98 and have it work.
        Perhaps it was sold in other countries as well.
      </p>
      <p>
        
      </p>
      <p>
        If your PC-98's built-in optical drive isn't working, it may be broken.
        My friend got two systems, and one would not respond to the eject
        button or turn its LED on at all. The other one, from the unit in
        otherwise worse condition, would blink, and after she swapped the drive
        into her other unit it worked just fine.
      </p>
      <p>
        You might not be able to pick any old CD drive; they may look like
        "normal" IDE drives, but in the Ce2 and Cs2 at least, they <i>might</i>
        actually use some non-ATAPI command set. We (my friend and I) aren't
        quite sure yet. I've seen one person suggest that the CDR-260 might be
        one of the <i>earliest</i> ATAPI compatible drives, but I can't
        guarantee anything. If it is truly an ATAPI drive, then I expect you
        could put in some other standard IDE CD drive and have it function,
        although you still might not be able to get one where the tray, LED,
        and eject button line up with the holes in the case. I'd be interested
        to know if anyone manages to finagle something into working!
      </p>
      <p><a href="#pc9801_buying_wyatt_toc">[Top]</a></p>
      <h4 id="pc9801_buying_wyatt_odd_scsi">SCSI Drives</h4>
      <p>
        The other option is a SCSI optical drive. Since my PC-486GR never came
        with an optical drive internally, and doesn't even have IDE, this is my
        only option. Working SCSI CD drives can be had for prices that aren't
        ludicrous still, but expect to pay about what you would for a used
        Blu-Ray writer drive for one (as of 2023).
      </p>
      <p>
        ZuluSCSI can also emulate a CD drive, if you are so inclined. As of now
        it looks like the boards currently on the market can't do CD Digital
        Audio (CDDA) playback, which would be a huge minus for me. maybe there'll be
        a hardware mod or something that I can do to retrofit it to mine, since
        there is now a hardware design (which has not been produced to my
        knowledge) that also carries CDDA.
      </p>
      <p>
        I don't know which if any PC-98 models used internal SCSI optical
        drives, but I don't have that option so I would be daisy chaining
        my CD drive to my SCSI bus after (or before) the hard drive.
        Make sure your hard drive (if applicable) and optical drive SCSI
        ID's don't overlap; you may have to adjust some jumpers or DIP switches
        or press a button on the casing of your drive to change this and avoid
        overlap.
      </p>
      <p>
        Then, with SCSI optical drives, the problem becomes making it work with
        DOS.

      <p>
        DOS doesn't know what a CD drive is, normally. It needs extensions
        loaded into it to be able to access them. This is also true in the
        IBM-compatible DOS world, but the drivers are a little different,
        seemingly. This section will basically assume you're using a SCSI
        drive, but might mention alternatives for IDE drive users here and
        there.

        <span id="pc9801_buying_wyatt_odd_scsi_nec_brand"><b>NEC Brand Drives</b></span><br/>
        If you are using an NEC brand SCSI optical drive and an NEC SCSI-1
        controller, you can probably use the <code>NECCDA.SYS</code> driver. If
        it's an NEC SCSI optical drive and an NEC SCSI-II controller, I think
        that means you need the <code>NECCDB.SYS</code> driver instead. There's
        also <code>NECCD.SYS</code> to try, as well as every other letter in
        the range of <code>NECCD[A-K].SYS</code> at least.
      </p>
      <p>
        Yeah, I know it's annoying. I can't find nice documentation to figure
        out which drives go with which drivers, but I know at least <b>some</b>
        of the drivers are for IDE drives. <b>I suspect most if not all of the
          NECCD[C-K] range are for various IDE variants.</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        Not all of those drivers come with NEC MS-DOS, even in version 6.2 (the
        last released version). In addition, the above only seems to matter if
        you are using an NEC branded SCSI drive; I wasn't able to get that
        driver to detect my drive (non-NEC) at all unless I spoofed an NEC
        vendor ID, and if I did that then the computer hung during
        initialization of the driver. But by most accounts, <b>if you are
          within the NEC ecosystem</b>, the above are the drivers to use.
        It may be possible that <i>some</i> other drives will also work with
        some of those drivers. I can't confirm this.

        If you aren't using an NEC brand drive/controller, it could be that
        trying to use the NEC drivers makes your system freeze.
      </p>
      <p>
        Mine <i>did</i> freeze; I suppose it could just be that the NEC driver
        is doing an "Epson Check" and intentionally sabotaging me for not using
        their hardware. If that is all it is, then there's supposed to be an
        Epson installer tool somewhere specifically made to patch out these
        "Epson Checks" in NEC software. But I didn't think of that until
        afterwards, so I looked for other, non-NEC solutions.
      </p>
      <p>
        I had to use a different driver to connect my SCSI CD drive, which
        I found on archive.org and in case anything ever happens to it.
        The driver in question is <code>CDSD.SYS</code>, which is under an open
        source license, from what I can tell. The source code seems to be
        available <a href="http://ysflight.in.coocan.jp/FM/towns/cdsd/CDSD_SRC.ZIP">here</a>
        - note that it also appears it can be built for FM Towns! There is also
        a version of the source code, which looks like it may be older, on
        <a href="https://www.vector.co.jp/soft/dos/hardware/se000298.html">Vector.jp</a>,
        which I have also used to find a floppy disk image converter in the
        past.
      </p>
      <p>
        The "newer" version might actually be patched for FM Towns, so if
        there are issues maybe try the older version.
      </p>
      <p>
        The FM Towns developer that is hosting that first CDSD source download
        also has an English-language writeup of the problems that he/she/they
        had, and patches for them.

          writeup can be found here</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        There's additional notes about patches for CD-SD
        <a href="http://akiyuki.boy.jp/old/t98next/midi/scsi4cd.zip">here,</a>
        seemingly from the author of the T98-Next emulator author, to make it

        <b>I have successfully used the last of those options</b> (reading the

        there exactly, using the downloads from vector.jp and archived

        Finally, I should note that

          this Japanese blogger</a> seems to have figured out how to assemble

        If doing a fresh install, or maybe also if running NEC DOS, you can
        try to let the installer automatically configure your driver for you.
        It might work, even if your drive is not NEC. I can't guarantee
        anything.
      </p>
      <p>
        If it hangs after a reboot, though, you will need to use a DOS boot
        floppy disk to edit the hard drive's <code>AUTOEXEC.BAT</code> and
        <code>CONFIG.SYS</code> files to remove the offending lines (which
        will contain the phrase <code>CD_101</code> in every case I have seen
        so far). You can also just prefix those lines with <code>REM </code>
        (the space after <code>REM</code> is important), which is how you
        comment out lines in both <code>BAT</code> files and in
        <code>CONFIG.SYS</code>.
      </p>
      <span class="emphatic"><b>NOTE:</b> <i>MS-DOS versions prior to 6.0</i>
        DO NOT <i>support</i> '</span><code>REM</code><span class="emphatic"><i>'

          But they</i> should <i>still support it in AUTOEXEC.BAT.</i></span>
      <p>
        If DOS is already installed and you want to add a drive, I think the
        correct step is probably to run the <code>CUSTOM</code> command, which
        seems to be NEC's tool for automatically managing
        <code>CONFIG.SYS</code> and <code>AUTOEXEC.BAT</code> for some typical
        use cases. I can't really help you with it, though, because I don't
        even know where to begin and I am more comfortable manually editing
        CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT anyway as far as CD drives are concerned.

        If you've never messed around much in DOS before (including western
        versions), some of this might be new to you. It's not too new to me,
        but that doesn't mean I love the process, either. Basically, though,
        here's the steps as I understand them. I hope I don't leave anything
        out.
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>Step 1</i>:<br/>
        Step one is getting the driver files. Some of them
        (<code>NECCDA.SYS</code>, <code>NECCDB.SYS</code>,
        <code>NECCDC.SYS</code>, <code>NECCDD.SYS</code>,
        and maybe(?) <code>NECCDCHK.SYS</code>) are included on the NEC
        MS-DOS 6.2 floppy disk set (on disk 1). They should be installed
        already, but if not, you can copy them off of the floppy disk.
        They will be named with <code>.SY_</code> extensions instead of
        <code>.SYS</code>, because <b>these are compressed files that need to
          be unpacked.</b> If they were installed already, they are already
        unpacked.
      </p>
      <p>
        To unpack a file like this, you need <code>EXPAND.EXE</code>, which is
        available in uncompressed form on NEC MS-DOS 6.2's disk 1 as well.
        If you booted from your hard drive and put the DOS installer disk in
        the first floppy drive afterwards, then your hard drive will be <code>A:</code>
        and your floppy disk will be in drive <code>B:</code> - this is
        different from the IBM PC, but important to note.
      </p>
      <p>Assuming that the above is true (you booted from your hard drive),
        the following should work to change your 'current directory' to the
        root of the B drive and unpack the file back to the hard disk.
      </p>
      <div class="codewrap">
        <pre class="block">B:
cd &yen;
expand NECCDA.SY_ A:&yen;DOS&yen;NECCDA.SYS</pre>
      </div>
      <p>
        If you don't have the <code>A:&yen;DOS</code> directory, then you can
        just output it to <code>A:&yen;NECCDA.SYS</code> instead.
      </p>
      <p>
        Also note, of course, that in Japanese DOS/Windows, the yen sign (&yen;)
        serves the same function as backslash (\), and is actually using the
        exact same character numeric representation internally. It's just
        that Japan's "code page" replaces \ with &yen;.
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>Step 2</i>:<br/>
        Step two is editing <code>CONFIG.SYS</code>.This is a special file in
        DOS that tells it about the drivers it should load at startup, and how
        it should load them. In other words, because we need to tell DOS about
        our CD driver, it must have a <code>CONFIG.SYS</code> entry.
      </p>
      <div class="imgcontain imgwrap" id="pc9801_buyying_wyatt_configsys">
        <a href="pc9801_1/full/config_sys.png">
          <img src="pc9801_1/config_sys.png"
               alt="(Screenshot of me editing my config.sys file.)"/>
        </a>
        <div class="imgwrap caption imgcentercaption">
          Me editing my CONFIG.SYS file. I use 'jed' as my text editor, but
          'SEDIT' is the one that is shipped with NEC DOS 6.2.
        </div>
      </div>
      <p>
        Unfortunately, as far as I can recall, you can't load a CD driver
        without first loading some other drivers. I've provided my CONFIG.SYS
        file, in case it helps you to figure things out. A lot of it is
        irrelevant, but I think it depends on at least <code>HIMEM.SYS</code>
        and <code>EMM386.EXE</code> to work properly. You will have to adjust
        it to look in the right places, if your hard drive is organized
        differently from mine. I think mine is pretty standard in this
        instance, though.
      </p>
      <p>
        So here is my <code>CONFIG.SYS</code>:
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="emphatic"><b>NOTE:</b> <i>If you are directly
            copying and pasting this text into a file and moving it to your
            PC-98, you MUST replace all '</i></span> <code>&yen;</code><span class="emphatic"><i>' characters with '</i></span> <code>\</code><span class="emphatic"><i>'
            characters before moving it to the PC-98!</i></span><br/>
        This is because a unicode '<code>&yen;</code>' character is represented by
        different bytes than a
        <a href="https://www.sljfaq.org/afaq/encodings.html#encodings-JIS-X-0201">JIS-X-0201/code page 932</a>
        '<code>&yen;</code>'. The byte representing the character '<code>\</code>' in ASCII
        is the same byte that represents '<code>&yen;</code>' in CP932.
      </p>
      <div class="codewrap">
        <pre class="block">FILES=30
BUFFERS=10
SHELL=&yen;COMMAND.COM /P

DEVICE=A:&yen;DOS&yen;HIMEM.SYS

DEVICE=A:&yen;DOS&yen;CDSD.SYS /D:CD_101 /I5

LASTDRIVE=Q
DOS=HIGH,UMB</pre>
      </div>
      <p>
        I believe the important bits there are the lines with
        <code>HIMEM.SYS</code>, <code>EMM386.EXE</code>, and
        <code>CDSD.SYS</code>. If they aren't already there, anything else in
        this example can probably be omitted. For instance, the
        <code>LOGITEC</code> things are for my specific SCSI controller,
        but I don't think you need to have a special driver loaded for your
        particular controller board. Just try them if you have problems
        (with your appropriate card's drivers, of course).
      </p>
      <p>
        The <code>/P=64</code> argument to <code>EMM386</code> can likely be
        omitted; EMM386 defaults to using all of the expanded memory area it
        can (rather than just 64 pages, like that is specifying). It was just
        automatically added by something or another and I haven't had a reason
        to change it yet. But the <b>important</b> arguments are the ones to
        <code>CDSD.SYS</code> - particularly, you need to know your optical
        drive's SCSI ID and feed it as an argument to <code>CDSD</code> or it
        will fail with a complaint about an invalid SCSI ID. It seems to be a
        somewhat common convention to make the drives with ID's 5 and 6 optical
        drives, so if you only have one or two optical drives <code>/I:5</code>
        makes sense. To add a drive 6, you'd simply add a second
        <code>CDSD.SYS</code> line... I think. If my understanding is correct,
        in that case you'd also need to name the driver (<code>/D:</code>)
        something else for a secondary optical drive; maybe CD_102. The
        name actually apparently does not matter, as long as it matches up with
        a line in <code>AUTOEXEC.BAT</code> (which we will get to next).
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>Step 3</i>:<br/>
        Finally, we need to edit <code>AUTOEXEC.BAT</code>. This is another
        special file that DOS looks for and reads at startup. The difference
        is that <code>AUTOEXEC.BAT</code> runs commands just like a user can at
        a command prompt manually; I don't <i>think</i> there's a way to
        manually load in drivers like <code>CONFIG.SYS</code> does.
      </p>
      <p>
        In our case, <code>AUTOEXEC.BAT</code> needs to run a program called
        <code>MSCDEX.EXE</code>, Microsoft's CD Extensions program. I suppose
        it's what DOS calls a TSR program (terminate-stay-resident), in that
        it loads its code into memory for other programs to hook into later
        when they need to access the CD drive. It's a sort of workaround for
        the lack of multitasking to make it so programmers don't have to have
        their own CD driver as part of their software's code. I guess you could
        also say it's like some horrible kind of shared library (like DLL's).
      </p>
      <p>
        Anyway - here's my AUTOEXEC.BAT.
      </p>
      <div class="codewrap">
        <pre class="block">PATH A:&yen;DOS;A:&yen;
SET TEMP=A:&yen;DOS
SET DOSDIR=A:&yen;DOS
A:&yen;DOS&yen;MSCDEX.EXE /D:CD_101 /L:Q
A:&yen;DOS&yen;SMARTDRV.EXE /X</pre>
      </div>
      <p>
        You can ignore the <code>SMARTDRV</code> line; it's for hard drive data
        caching, which speeds up disk drive use sometimes. I don't know if it
        does anything for CD speeds. <code>MSCDEX</code> is the only critical
        one, I believe.
      </p>
      <p>
        It seems to be another convention with the PC-98 for things to map the
        optical drive to drive letter Q. Weird, isn't it. I think I might get
        it though; if they are the farthest drive letters down the list that
        they can be, then adding another hard drive or floppy drive is less
        likely to mess up any scripts that might have been written assuming
        that drive 'D:' would be a floppy disk or something. Since the PC-98
        uses a proper Shugart interface instead of IBM's version of it, it
        can have four floppy drives, so this makes a little more sense. But
        if you want to change the drive letter from 'Q:' to something else,
        you change the <code>/L:Q</code> to
        <code>/L:(your-drive-letter)</code>.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Two SCSI Drives</b><br/>
        Here's how I would <b>guess</b> you would change it to use two CD
        drives with SCSI ID's 5 and 6, mapped to drive letters P and Q.
        This is only a guess.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>One IDE Drive and One SCSI Drive</b><br/>
        You should also be able to mix and match drivers. I am assuming a
        driver file for the IDE drive is NECCDM.SYS, but <b>you may need
a different file.</b> If you have an internal IDE drive and an
        external SCSI drive, you might try something like this:

      <p>
        One final reminder: I do not know for sure that all of this works
        like I think it does. But that experience which I have with DOS leads
        me to believe it is so. DOS just has a way of defying my expectations.

      <p>
        Planning on using real floppy disks? You'll need some good diskettes.
        These are no longer being made, so you'll have to buy new old stock (or
        used, if you feel very lucky) - unless you already have some of course.
      </p>
      <p>
        Older PC-98's use DD (double density) diskettes and drives, and the
        drives can't reliably write to 1.44MB HD floppy disks which have lower
        coercivity, and need stronger magnetism to flip a bit from a zero to a one
        or vice versa. So if yours is an older model (before around 1993 or
        1994), you almost certainly need DD diskettes.
      </p>
      <p>
        It may also be a good idea to invest in a cleaning kit, or perhaps find
        a way to clean the drives without one. It only takes one bad disk to
        mess up a floppy drive and make it need a cleaning to avoid ruining
        good disks.
      </p>
      <p>
        I wish it were easier to keep using real ones, because I do happen to
        like using them... when they work.

      <h3 id="pc9801_buying_wyatt_writing_floppies_linux">Writing Floppy Disks (Linux)</h3>
      <p>
        The key to writing floppies for a PC-98 in Linux is to use a program
        called "ufiformat." Especially if your PC-98 is not new enough to
        support 300 RPM 1.44MB disk reading/writing, it is absolutely
        essential.
      </p>
      <p>
        I wrote a script for me and my friend that handles the details of
        setting up a floppy disk for the PC-98 series. It depends on the
        following utilities (and perhaps more).
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
A bourne shell (any standard, non-<code>csh</code>-type Linux/Unix
          shell)
        </li>
        <li><code>ufiformat</code></li>
        <li><code>lsscsi</code></li>
        <li><code>awk</code></li>
        <li><code>sudo</code></li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The <code>sudo</code> calls can all be removed if you plan to invoke
        the script as root. So I don't actually consider <code>sudo</code> to
        be a hard dependency.

        I have yet to successfully write Ys, which should be a smaller
        game that uses a DD floppy instead of HD&hellip; but for whatever
        reason, the game I write always has some bugs that don't appear in
        emulators. I almost wonder if it is intentional copy protection,
        because my friend was also able to get the same bugs to appear on a
        real diskette as I had with my Goteks.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you have an original physical copy, you could probably make a
        kyroflux or greaseweasel disk dump which would work... but mine
        is from a Japanese online game market which bundles emulators with
        games - I extracted the disk image from it. So perhaps I need to
        try to find an original physical copy.

      <p>
        I have absolutely no clue how to format a floppy disk to 1.2MB at
        360RPM under any version of Windows. My one floppy disk imaging tool of
        choice doesn't work, because it assumes all floppies are 1.44MB.
        And I don't even know what the API call would be in software to
        communicate a mode change to the floppy drive in Windows. I guess
        Greaseweazle would work, since it lets you read and write to the disk
        with no interference from a floppy controller. But that's a hardware
        solution no other platform needs.
      </p>
      <p>
        I tried to help my friend to do it in Windows and came back empty every
        time we tried. Thankfully she also has a laptop with Debian on it, so
        we were able to write disks in a matter of minutes that way.

      <h3>FlashFloppy/HxC</h3>
      <p>
        Planning on forgoing floppy drives? You'll need to get some floppy
        drive emulators. A lot of games require that you have disks in two drives
        at once, so just one probably won't work, until/unless the FlashFloppy
        firmware fork for emulating two drives with one Gotek comes together.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Gotek drives and FlashFloppy firmware (you can't use the stock Gotek
        firmware) have been discussed at length elsewhere on the web, so I will
        probably talk about what I had to do for my Epson but won't give general
        advice on how to get FlashFloppy onto a Gotek just now.
      </p>
      <h4>Where to put the drive emulators?</h4>
      <p>
        You want to just replace the original drives? Well, depending on your
        exact model, that might not be too easy. A lot of machines, both
        from Epson and from NEC itself, have floppy disk shaped slots moulded
        into the outer casing for a pre-set number of drives, and won't even
        accept other <i>real</i> floppy drives, if they have the eject button
        in a slightly different position. I consider this to be kind of a jerk
        way to do things, but it seems that it was quite common for companies
        to do this to make their drives integrate more smoothly/aesthetically
        into the casing.
      </p>
      <p>
        If your PC doesn't have nice open rectangular holes in the case, then
        even if you don't want to modify your casing, all hope might not be
        lost. Note that I have not done this yet - but many if not all PC-98's
        have an external floppy drive connector on the back of the system. It
        uses a variant of the so-called "centronics" connector. I believe it
        should be possible to modify your system to identify external drives as
        the first and second drive and to prefer those over the internal ones.
      </p>
      <p>
        Again, I haven't done this, but if the floppy drive 0 and 1 selection
        pins are exposed on the "centronics" connector, then you could simply
        disconnect the internal ones or flip some BIOS setting/DIP switch and
        be good to go. If those lines aren't exposed externally, you can simply
        hijack those lines from the internal floppy drives' ribbon cable and
        pass them out with a method of your choosing.
      </p>
      <p>
        I might elaborate on this if I need to, but for now I will assume you
        can figure out a floppy drive solution that works for you, and
        I will explain how I did mine (internally).
      </p>
      <h4 id="pc9801_buying_wyatt_adding_goteks">Adding Goteks internally on the Epson PC-486GR</h4>
      <p>
        I decided I was going to forego floppies. I just can't trust them
        anymore and I know I'm going to run out of good ones some day.
        Additionally, it could be that I just had the DIP switches configured
        wrong at the time and the floppy drives actually are just fine,
        but when I first got it, it wouldn't boot anything. I haven't tried
        the real drives since fixing the DIP switches. I think the last owner
        had them set up for external floppy drive booting.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Epson PC-486GR has two or three floppy drives internally, depending
        on your configuration from the factory. These drives are a little...
        quirky. But they do work and can be adapted to use Goteks instead.
      </p>
      <p>
        For starters, the Epson's 3.5" bays have brackets to fit them in a
        5.25" wide slot in the case, but <b>these slots are not as tall as a
          standard 5.25" bay slot</b>, so you can't just use a normal PC
        mounting bracket for attaching a floppy drive. I was unfortunate
        enough to have pre-emptively ordered two adapter brackets that I now
        cannot use. Anyone want them?&hellip;
      </p>
      <p>
        The <b>good</b> news is that the brackets that come in the Epson are
        able to mount a standard 3.5" floppy drive or Gotek just fine - with
        the caveat that you won't have a nice plastic bezel to cover up the
        gaps on the sides of the Gotek. That's why I have masking tape on the
        front of mine. When I'm not looking directly at it, it's fine! And it
        blocks a little of the noise from the blower fan on the 75 MHz 486 DX4
        that mine has been upgraded with by the previous owner inside.
      </p>
      <p>
        Yes; I know the sticker says 50MHz DX2. But there's some other kind of
        accelerator card - which the Japanese seem to call a
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geta_(footwear)">Geta</a> -
        inside of it that I am pretty sure is not an Epson product.
      </p>
      <p>
        I am guessing they are called "geta" because of the way that the CPU
        sort of sits on a PCB with pins (like the vertical boards on the shoes)
        underneath that sort of look like stilts. This board is required
        because the 486 DX4 runs at 3.3 volts rather than the 5 volts of the
        original 486 SX/DX and DX2, thus needing a voltage converter between
        it and the PC itself.
      </p>
      <p>
        &hellip;But I digress.
      </p>
      <p>
        The <i>bad</i> news is that if you bought one of these with the 2x
        5.25" drive configuration, you weren't given that bracket! - You might
        have to either find someone selling the 3.5" floppy drives for one on
        their own or else make your own adapter (or find a pre-made one that
        fits the slot). If you have access to wood and are a little crafty, you
        could probably carve one. Or you could 3D print one. Maybe you could
        also make one with Lego, or something? - I believe, but cannot confirm,
        that the 486GR's floppy drive bay is the same as the one in some of the
        earlier Epson PC-286 and PC-386 lines, so you may be able to find a
        listing for drives from one of those. That is, if they were offered
        with 3.5" disk drives. NEC was kind of late to move to 3.5" disks.
      </p>
      <p>
        The 3.5" drives used in the 486GR2, 486GR2E, and 486GR3 models&ndash; the
        versions of the 486GR that aren't 5.25" only&ndash; are
        <a href="https://98epjunk.shakunage.net/fdd/md3541g_smd_pin.html">model
          MD3541G</a>, which seems to have been made by Canon (yes; that's
        Canon, the camera and printer company. Not by some other company called
        Canon that you never heard of).
      </p>
      <p>
        By the way, it seems to be confirmed by that last link that Epson's
        <a href="https://pc-9800.net/db_epson/data/pc-386ge.htm">PC-386GE</a>
        (PC-386GE2, PC-386GE2B, PC-386GE3) and
        <a href="https://pc-9800.net/db_epson/data/pc-386gs.htm">PC-386GS</a>
        (PC-386GS2, PC-386GS2E, PC-386GS3) also use the MD3541G. So, if you
        find one cheap, maybe you could consider using it as an oversized
        external 3.5" floppy drive unit for your 486? :)
      </p>
      <p>
        An additional oddity is that the Epson uses laptop-style 26 pin floppy
        disk drives that connect via flat flex cable, attached to an adapter
        board that converts them to use full-sized 5.25" drive card edge
        connectors and large 4-pin "molex" power connectors.

        </div>
      </div>
      <p>
        Since I don't want or need that adapter board anymore, I need to find
        another way to deliver power to the Gotek and to make the ribbon cable
        actually reach the drives' connectors, since the Goteks don't reach the
        backs of the drive brackets. This means "Molex" to "Berg" power
        adapters, as well as IDC to card edge floppy adapters, <i>plus</i> some
        homemade extension boards to bridge the remaining distance from the IDC
        connector to where the ribbon cable connects at the rears of the
        brackets.

        Someone might be quick to criticize my soldering work. I honestly think

        Do note, however, that in the final installation there is more
        clearance between the metal shielding and the extension board than
        there may appear to be in this photo. Additionally, the insulated wires
        jumping over the board keep the board act as a "bumper" that prevents
        the perfboard from contacting the metal above it.
      </p>
      <p>
        It's been bulletproof since installation, honestly. I probably wouldn't
        make the extension boards exactly like that again, but I don't regret
        doing it this way this time.

        I have noticed that whenever the drives are not active, the drive

        figured out why that is, nor how the original drives sidestepped the
        problem - although I assume that saturating a capacitor was involved.
        The drive lights come on to full brightness normally when the system
        actually tries to read something or write something.

        Just because I feel like trying to be helpful, I'll share an adapter

        I don't recommend making the spacers by hand like I did; it took a lot
        of time and I probably inhaled a lot of leaded solder fumes. It also

        Get it with hardened gold contacts on the edge connector if you can.
        Better to make or buy one board than to both make one and buy another.

      <p>
        The Touhou games are a huge reason a lot of people might buy a PC-98,
        and I have grown to enjoy them, so maybe they're worth mentioning in a
        special section.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you buy a "CanBe" or "Cereb" series PC-98 (Pentium era, uses a sound
        chip equivalent to a PC-9801-118 card), they use a YMF297 FM chip
        instead of a YM2608, and this presents some compatibility issues with
        the sound drivers used by the Touhou games (and other DOS games). But
        if all you care about is Touhou, I'm happy to tell you that these
        issues are fixable! So don't feel like those cheap Pentium-class
        CanBe's you see are utterly worthless! I'd not recommend one if you
        want to play a LOT of DOS games, but for Touhou it's plenty.

        PC-9801-118 Sound Sources</h3>
      <p>
        The first Touhou game uses a very different driver than all later
        Touhou PC-98 games. There are notes in Japanese
        <a href="http://j02.nobody.jp/jto98/n_desk_sound/canbsdi.htm">on this page</a>
        that describe how to make Touhou 1 run by downgrading a driver.
      </p>
      <p>
        "<a href="https://www.ne.jp/asahi/soft/mino/minosoft/railway/index.htm">Railway Goes On Far Away</a>"
        is a free game that contains a working version of the
        <code>MDRV98.COM</code> file you need to run the first Touhou game on a
        CanBe. Simply take <code>MDRV98.COM</code> and replace the file in
        your Touhou 1 installation directory (I would make a backup of its
        <code>MDRV98.COM</code> as well, first). This downgrades the driver from
        3.4F to 3.4E.

        The second touhou game has a patch, but that patch was not included on
        the game disks. It took me a while to find it, but it can be downloaded
        <a href="http://www.kt.rim.or.jp/~aotaka/am/get.htm">from here</a>.
        Run the program (or extract it; 7-zip will do it like an LZH file) and
        then copy the files into your Touhou 2 install folder. Then start the
        game by running <code>GAMECB.BAT</code>.

      <h3>Touhou 3 (Phantasmagoria of Dim.Dream) and 5 (Mystic Square) with
        CanBe / Cereb / PC-9801-118 Sound Sources</h3>
      <p>
        These games came bundled with a canbe patch version. Just run canbe.exe
        (or manually extract with 7-zip, like with Touhou 2) and run the
        unpacked <code>GAMECB.BAT</code> to launch the game, just like with
        Touhou 2.
      </p>
      <h3>Touhou 4 (Lotus Land Story) with CanBe / Cereb / PC-9801-118 Sound Sources</h3>
      <p>
        Touhou 4 is just like 2, 3, and 5, except for some reason it doesn't
        use a self-extracting executable, so you have to have LHA installed on
        your PC-98 to unpack it or else use 7-zip to do it. The files inside
        work the same way, though.
      </p>
      <p>
        You can also use <a href="https://www.vector.co.jp/soft/dos/util/se017776.html">LHE</a>
        to unpack LZH files. <code>lhe CANBE.LZH .</code> will unpack the file
        to your current directory.

      <h2>Japanese MS-DOS Help</h2>

        Unfortunately, even here, you can't escape from Microsoft's eternal

        different from western MS-DOS.

      <p>
        How you use this changes kind of wildly between versions. Basically I
        just run <code>sedit [file to edit]</code> so I don't have to figure
        out how to load a file, and then saving and exiting differs.
        I think on DOS version 5 it's F1 followed by 'S' to save, and maybe
        'Q' to quit. On DOS 3.3 I just hit f10 and choose the top item in the
        menu to both save and quit. I usually use
        <a href="https://www.vector.co.jp/soft/dos/writing/se005817.html">"JED"</a>
        instead, which is English and also feels more emacs-y.

        Here's some advice on caring for your PC. This extends to less exotic
        old computers, too, but contrary to what some people seem to think
        about 1980's Japanese build quality, it's still made by mortals and
        suffers from the same problems everything else has - although maybe to
        a lesser degree in some cases.
      </p>
      <p>
        Just looking online for listings of PC-98's will show you that a lot of
        them are rusting, for instance. Leaky Nickel Cadmium batteries are also
        a deficiency shared by many other computers from the period. Would I
        trust them more than an average Commodore product? Yeah, probably. But
        it's not really that hard to have better longevity than a Commodore
        64's PLA or power supply, in the grand scheme of things, and so it
        isn't saying much.
      </p>
      <p>
        This will include advice on both things you can do to prevent
        catastrophe, and things you can do so that when catastrophe strikes,
        you might be prepared for the eventuality and have the things you need
        to resurrect your computer.

      <h3 id="pc9801_buying_wyatt_bios_rom_dumping">Preventative Maintenance:
        Back Up Your BIOS ROM('s)!!</h3>
      <h4>(ROM Dumping)</h4>
      <p>
        It's a very good idea to take the ROM chips out of your PC-98 and make
        copies of them, if you have the equipment to do so. That way, it's
        easy to create replacements for them if the originals fail. One of my
        friend's PC-9821Ce2's has an EPROM-based BIOS in it, whereas the others
        look to be mask ROM. But I suppose those could be one-time-program
        EPROM's as well.  OTP chips are  also vulnerable to bit decay over the
        years just like EPROM's are. They're the same chips that are inside of
        EPROMs, but without the quartz crystal window in the chip "packaging"
        (outer shell). The window is meant to let light strike it when erasing
        is desired. Those are brown or purplish usually because they use a
        ceramic casing rather than a cheaper plastic one so that they can
        accomodate an erasing window.
      </p>
      <p>
        But there's a problem with this simple physical approach: I actually
        can't figure out where most of the ROM chips are on my 486GR! I
        haven't checked the underside of the motherboard yet, but nearly all
        the chips I thought could have been ROM's seem to be SRAM's, according
        to the internet. I was able to find one EPROM, in a QFP format, on its
        CPU card. I really hope that I've just overlooked them, and the rest
        are not buried inside one or more of Epson's ASIC's. ASIC means
        (Application-Specific Integrated Circuit. Basically they are single
        purpose chips that have functionality endemic to one or a handful of
        products and which typically perform hyper-specific tasks that
        wouldn't make sense outside of the specific equipment they are
        installed in). If they are, it <i>might</i> be a good thing - if it's
        mask ROM. But if it's not mask ROM, I really hope it doesn't give out.
        I am guessing it's mask ROM, if they were confident they got
        everything more or less right. Especially since they were already
        having custom chips made for this thing anyway. I can't imagine a mask
        ROM was that much extra to stick on a chip die with some other logic
        stuff.
      </p>
      <p>
        Regardless, though, if you don't want to pull out your EPROM programmer
        (or if, like me, you do not have one&hellip;), there is software that
        seems to be able to make okay dumps of BIOS ROM's. You can find its
        source code in the repository for the <a href="https://github.com/AZO234/NP2kai/tree/master/np2tool">Neko Project II
          Kai</a> emulator, in the <code>np2tool</code> directory, in the file
        <code>GETBIOS.ASM</code>. But it's probably easiest to use an existing
        binary build of <code>GETBIOS.COM</code> instead.
      </p>
      <p>
        The readme file for Neko Project II Kai implies that
        <code>GETBIOS.COM</code> is supposed to be a part of the
        <a href="https://github.com/AZO234/NP2kai/blob/master/np2tool/np2tool.zip">np2tool zip file</a>,
        but it clearly isn't, so you can instead
        <a href="http://retropc.net/yui/np2tool/index.html">grab it from this
          user's page on retropc.net</a>, as linked to from another, older Neko
        Project II Kai page which can be found
        <a href="https://simk98.github.io/np21w/download.html">here</a>. You
        might as well back up everything else using those other tools on
        the retropc.net page, too (specifically, <code>MAKEFONT</code>).
      </p>
      <p>
        Move your program(s) onto the PC-98 using whatever means are necessary.
        I suggest a floppy diskette or Gotek with a flash drive, but a hard
        drive could also work if you have another computer with an appropriate
        disk drive interface to connect it to. Make sure you have as much free
        space as possible on your floppy disk, if you choose that route. The
        font ROM is <i>rather large</i>.

        I'd love to share my dump with you here, but I am probably not allowed
        to do that, legally speaking. Don't like it? If you live in an
        ostensibly free country, maybe write to your representatives and pray
        for a miracle. Because unless theyu stop representing the interests of
        capital and start representing <i>you</i>, it's going to take a
        miracle for entrenched companies to do a complete 180 on this of their
        own volition.
      </p>
      <p>
        Maybe someone else out there in a country where it's legal to do so
        will make and share a copy of the 486GR ROM's some day; I hope that
        happens. Because I'll likely be dead or nearly 100 years old by the
        time the Epson's BIOS is public domain, and I'd guess most EPROM's
        and flash memory will have rotted away by the time my current country
        lets it go.
      </p>
      <p>
        Oh yeah; Steamboat Willie is public domain, now that anyone who
        remembers seeing it in a theater is dead. So have fun with that, guys!
        Only 73 more years to go for the Epson ROM's&hellip;!
      </p>
      <p>
        That copyright was around before I was born, and it'll still be around
        when I'm dead and buried in all likelihood. So It's unlikely I'll
        <i>ever</i> be allowed to share it while I'm breathing. You'll probably
        have to ask my next of kin and hope that they've kept it. Assuming
        that <i>they</i> haven't also kicked the bucket yet.
      </p>
      <p>
        Huh? What's that? You think I'm sounding a little bitter? Whatever
        would make you think something like <i>that</i>? Copyrights that last
        longer than human beings are only sensible. I for one pledge allegiance
        every day to our benevolent corporate hegemony&ndash; and to the Free
        Market,&trade; for which it stands.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b><i><u>ANYWAY</u></i>:</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        I can at least give you my checksums. I hope they're useful to you -
        Maybe if you get your own Epson, or your own PC-9801-86 sound board,
        it'll be good for comparing.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Disclaimer:</b> <i>This is not a "proper" ROM dump for the BIOS. That may
          require me to remove an EPROM from the CPU card on my Epson (assuming
          that's what that EPROM is) and dump it directly out-of-circuit. I
          think that ROM contains more than what the programs I used are
          capable of, so they would not be good enough for the MAME project,
          probably. I have neither an EPROM programmer to read it nor a proper
          QFP chip puller to safely remove the IC.</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        Note that I have the distinct feeling most of these program authors
        were not targeting Epsons when they wrote their ROM dumpers,
        so we just have to hope Epson implemented theirs identically to
        NEC's.
      </p>
      <p>
        The 86 sound ROM matches the checksum of the one in MAME's source
        code. The 26 sound ROM matches the checksum of the Epson PC-486MU's
        sound ROM in MAME's sources,  so they must use the same ROM and I am
        therefore guessing that the sound ROM is correct. Does it sound
        different than a real PC-9801-26K card does? Maybe! - or maybe they
        just omit the NEC copyright string from the Epson 26 Sound ROM.
      </p>
      <p>
        The font ROM does NOT match the checksum of the 486MU one in MAME's
        sources. But I've managed to find out that the 486MU's typeface
        actually just differs slightly. Someone hooked me up with a dump,
        which I immediately deleted after verifying this. I don't seriously
        think Epson is about to complain about that; not after they've erased
        almost all mention of the 486GR's very existance from their site.

        Notice how if you have an onboard sound source, its rom must be dumped
        with any other sound card removed and after making sure the internal
        source is re-enabled in your BIOS or DIP switches.
      </p>
      <p>
        While and after doing this, make sure there's no corruption on the
        floppy disk you're using to move the files to another computer, since
        unlike with most things, corruption in your BIOS ROM backup could be
        disastrous if you ever need to restore it and you find that your only
        copy was destroyed by a bad floppy disk.
      </p>
      <p>
        You might laugh, but I had this happen the first time I tried making a
        backup. Later backup attempts seemed to work better (using different
        media). I also did the second backup attempt using my hard drive and
        then copied from the HDD to the FDD after doing the dump so I could
        perhaps compare more easily. And of course, that way I have a copy
        backed up on the HDD, which isn't too bad of an idea to begin with.
        Just a little more redundancy if things go south.
      </p>
      <p>
        You might want to run the <code>MAKEFONT</code> program from that site,
        too, while you're at it. It'll generate a FONT.BMP file, which contains
        all of the font in a human readable picture format. I haven't figured
        out how to convert FONT.ROM into the FONT.BMP format (it seems to be
        compressed in some way), and some emulators use FONT.BMP instead of
        FONT.ROM. Also, it's just neat to see the whole font, and having it in
        a more human readable format is another plus.
      </p>
      <h4>Other ROM's</h4>
      <p>
        You might have other ROM's in your system. Some kinds of C-Bus cards
        (including some sound cards) have them, for instance; my SCSI
        controller is one of these. I don't know of a tool to dump roms from
        these cards, although one very probably exists. Maybe a linux boot
        would be enough to get access to them, sort of like how I can dump my
        newer PC's VGA BIOSes from <code>/sys/</code>. That's something I
        should probably try. It might or might not work; the steps that work
        for dumping my VGA BIOS option ROM are shown on
        <a href="http://etherboot.org/wiki/romdumping">here on etherboot.org</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        By the way, an "option ROM" is IBM's terminology for any accessory card
        or hardware that contains a ROM that is supposed to be accessed by the
        computer's main processor(s). It's an old piece of terminology,
        contemporary with phrases like "PC compatible," "IBM Compatible," and
        so on. IBM's marketing jargon was "Options by IBM," and IBM used that
        word instead of "accessory" a lot of the time. Your IBM PC didn't get
        accessories or expansions; it got <i>options</i>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Anyway, I just think it's neat that that little fragment of 1980's PC
        terminology has just barely held on still; even UEFI systems support
        loading from ROM's. That said, they have to be crafted differently than
        old style BIOS ROM's, and aren't compatible. Microsoft's documentation
        still calls them UEFI option ROM's, though!
      </p>
      <p>
        On the IBM PC platform, a SCSI controller or other device that requires
        boot initialization or can control the computer from very early on is
        still readable after boot. Assuming the PC-98 doesn't do something very
        strange with some bus arbiter or something, I don't see why one
        wouldn't be able to dump, for instance, a SCSI boot ROM without
        resorting to an external piece of dumping hardware. I have yet to try
        this because I have been able to find dumps of my cards' rom's around
        the web already and I am thus less worried about immediately backing
        mine up... Although I still should.

        doesn't seem to consider the following to be "A-MATE" series machines.
        I am assuming that is because the following machines have window
        accelerators built-in and are therefore sort of "post-apocalyptic" as
        far as DOS goes.

        There's at least one guy I've seen online in the Anglosphere who has a
        9821An that he had to replace a bunch of caps on, too. So I guess maybe
        it's just that <i>all of the A series</i> are maybe likely to have bad
        caps.
      </p>
      <p>
        The problems mainly seem to be capacitors going bad, primarily in the
        power supplies. I get the impression that they may also have problems
        with early surface mount electrolytic capacitors going bad, since
        people often speak of them in the same sentence as they talk about
        later-model Sharp X68000 computers (which I believe also had
        motherboard capacitor issues).
      </p>
      <p>
        I also bought an 86 sound board which all the caps had leaked on. THAT
        was fun. I could get the barest semblance of audio out of one side with
        my speakers cranked to max, and nothing from the other. I got a second
        one that was already recapped for entirely too much and the one in need
        of recapping sits until I have a hot air soldering station. It seems
        that at least some 86 sound boards had the same issue as the A-series
        computers (which also used surface mount electrolytic capacitors).
      </p>
      <p>
        In general, it's a good idea to replace capacitors in all old
        electronics one gets, but I don't really always follow my own advice.
        Capacitor failures might just cause a problem that can be fixed by
        replacing the capacitor, but they can also cause cascading failures
        where more stuff fails, either immediately or after a short delay
        (if the cap isn't immediately replaced). Even if the device appears to
        continue working, if you hear a POP coming from your electronics, don't
        ignore it. I just can't <i>afford</i> to follow it, but seriously if
        the wrong capacitor(s) pop I might be looking for a whole new computer
        or CRT or whatever, or buying a lot of parts other than capacitors to
        fix what just broke. Please, please, please consider recapping your
        stuff, if you can afford to and have the time to. I know some repair
        places will also do it for you. There's a local shop that rebuilds
        speakers where I live that also can do recap work for people. Maybe
        you have somewhere like that you can ask around at?        
      </p>
      <p>
        It should also be said that the "A" series models are considered quite
        good when they're in working condition. They're more easily expandible
        than the Ce2 and Cs2 systems are, with a socket so you can
        upgrade CPU's and an extra C-bus slot, and they are at least as
        featureful, with Integrated 86 sound and all of that good stuff. So if
        you can do the work, or if you can get it done by someone, they might
        still be a great choice.
      </p>
      <p>
        Do note that the A series mentioned above might not be capable of
        touhou in stock configuration, but with a CPU upgrade it could be
        pretty good for that. Make sure you factor in that cost when deciding,
        should you be invested in playing the Touhou games. Deriving from the
        information in ZUN (the developer)'s readme file, You'd want at least
        66MHz to play it. That means a 2x multiplier 486DX2 or equivalent if
        your computer has a 33MHz bus, and 3x+ multiplier
        486DX4/Am5x86/Cx5x86/whatever else I'm forgetting about for a 25MHz bus
        one.
      </p>
      <p>
        I think it may be possible to convert a 25MHz bus computer into a 33MHz
        bus one by replacing a "crystal" (quartz-based oscillator) on the
        motherboard, but I don't know if other things might need changing. And
        you'd defintely have to know how to solder to even try that. 
      </p>
      <h4>The Touhou Problem</h4>
      <h5>See also: <a href="#pc9801_buying_wyatt_touhou">Touhou Project Notes</a></h5>
      <p>
        The Touhou games present a special challenge, if you want your
        old DOS game compatible system to also be able to run it at a good
        speed.
      </p>
      <p>
        <i><b>The Ce2 and Cs2 (and the stock 486GR, for that matter) are
            not ideal if you want to play Touhou,</b></i> since the Ce2 and
        Cs2 have no CPU socket (they have a soldered-down 486SX only). If you
        were very good at soldering and had the right tools, you could of
        course replace that with a different one by soldering it in. Or look
        for a pretty uncommon accelerator board that piggybacks on top of the
        soldered-down CPU. I haven't seen one of them for sale in months.
        The 486GR, several other Epson models, and most of NEC's "A" line (and
        maybe B line?) have CPU sockets.
      </p>
      <h4>So What Should I get?</h4>
      <p>
        <b>If you don't need Touhou,</b> then almost definitely a 9821Ce2 or
        9821Cs2. They are in a sweet spot for compatibility with older stuff
        and having 86 sound built in. You may also consider a 9821Ce or 9821Cs
        (sans 2); those have a 486 ODP socket on them. The downsides are that
        the Ce and Cs are older, and only have two C-bus slots, and use SCSI
        drives (both optical and hard disk) internally... and SCSI stuff tends
        to cost more. If you keep a hard disk inside, then that means you won't
        need a C-bus card for that, so I'd say both slots would likely be
        filled by an 86 sound card and a MIDI card, if it were me.
      </p>
      <p>
        But with that being said, <b>I have been told by a Japanese native(?)
          that the Ce (not Ce2) has an "NEC check" in its onboard SCSI
          controller;</b> that means it might not let you use non-NEC hard
        drives and/or optical drives if they're connected. That kind of ruins a
        lot for me. So I'd suggest a Ce2, either an Epson model with an 86
        sound board + SCSI controller, or a Ce2/Cs2. Or A-MATE series if you
        are prepared to replace every electrolytic capacitor on it.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you have a computer with an ODP socket instead of a normal one, then
        you either need to ground the extra pin on the socket and use a normal
        CPU or pay the silly prices for an "overdrive" 486 with the extra pin
        on ebay (can be over four times the cost. Sure, the ODP's have write
        back or whatever... but I suspect half of it is just people not wanting
        to solder a wire to the motherboard).
      </p>
      <p>
        My friend got three Ce2's and a Cs2, all untested, and all of them more
        or less worked. One had a bad optical drive, and they all needed their
        floppy drive heads cleaned, and one had a hard drive that had had a
        head crash, so that needed replacing, but since they use IDE that's not
        as painful as it can be with SCSI drives. And the motherboards and
        power supplies all worked just fine, So maybe they've actually aged
        better than the A series did?
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>If you need Touhou and also other DOS games,</b> get a recapped
        A-MATE (one of the PC-9821Ap* models from the list above), or any 25MHz
        or faster 486-class PC-98 or Epson 98 clone with an ODP socket that you
        can put a 486DX4 into. <b>You will also need a voltage converter board
          or you might fry the DX4 when you put it in.</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>If you <i>ONLY</i> need Touhou,</b> get either a 9821 C166/C200/C233
        "cereb," or a PC-9801-118 sound board plus a V166/V200/V233 "ValueStar"
        and then use the "CanBe" sound patches for the games. These have a 166
        to 233 MHz Pentium MMX CPU in them, and will provide a VERY smooth
        experience with minimal slowdown. Information on the "CanBe" patches
        can be found in the <a href="#pc9801_buying_wyatt_touhou">"Touhou Project
          Notes"</a> section on this page. You may even have a superior
        experience to anyone who uses any kind of 486. Even MIDI in Touhou 2
        can work if you change the address of the GamePort in the BIOS without
        needing any more boards. But you'll have to use a joystick-to-keyboard
        adapter if you want to use a gamepad or MSX/Atari style Joystick.
      </p>
      <p>
        The ValueStar models do not have a YMF288 on board for sound, so you
        will need to get a PC-9801-118 card or solder a YMF288 to the board
        yourself (and possibly support circuitry).
      </p>
      <p>
        You could even get multiple PC-98's; one Ce2, one Pentium-class for
        Touhou, and maybe even a third PC-98 (like a 9801V* or 9801RA) for very
        old games that run best on an NEC V30 CPU. Most stuff runs fine on a
        Ce2, though, so the third might be optional.

        Capacitors
      </h3>
      <p>
        I bought a PC-9801-86 sound card that was covered in capacitor leakage
        and didn't work properly when plugged in. Be cautious, especially when
        surface mount type capacitors are involved. They are hard to desolder
        safely with an iron (without ripping up traces/solder pads), and early
        ones <b>love</b> to die. Upon desoldering, they will smell strangely
        like fish. A hot air station is recommended (to maximize the smell of
        fish).
      </p>
      <p>
        As far as I can tell, both my Epson and my friend's PC-9821 Ce2's/Cs2's
        are using only through-hole capacitors on their mainboards - so you
        should be safe-ish with those. But it's still always a good idea to
        replace old capacitors, even if I don't practice what I preach.
      </p>
      <p>
        Additionally, the PC-9821 A* series computers seem to have problematic
        capacitors in their power supplies rather frequently. I would suggest
        replacing all capcitors in those, if you go for one of them. Or find a
        PSU that was already recapped (probably expensive).
      </p>
      <p>
        If you ever turn your computer or monitor on and hear a loud
        <b>BANG</b> or a popping noise, you probably just blew a capacitor.
        Even if everything appears fine, you probably should immediately stop
        using the computer until you've either found the popped cap or
        replaced all of them. All of them is better, but it's both kind of
        expensive and quite labor intensive, and I get that. I'll still
        recommend you do it, but the one thing you <b>definitely</b> should
        avoid is continuing to use the computer after a capacitor blows.
        Eventually, things operating out of spec like that can cause more
        cascading failures that are possibly much harder to repair.

      <h3 id="pc9801_buying_wyatt_maintenance_rust">
        Corrosion
      </h3>
      <p>
        There are two main ways corrosion strikes in a computer, in my
        experience. One is case or RF shielding rusting, and the other is
        corrosion on the circuit boards. 
      </p>
      <h4>PCB Corrosion</h4>
      <p>
        A lot of PC-98's I see for sale suffer from some degree of rusting on
        the shell. This is annoying, but if not severe then it's
        <i>probably</i> fine. For more information, if you have case rust and
        it bothers, you, you can read more about it later in this section.
      </p>
      <p>
        The <b>very real</b> problem is that of battery leaking and PCB
        corrosion. Earlier models are probably more likely to have
        Nickel-Cadmium barrel batteries, which are a bane to pretty much anyone
        who wants to use a vintage computer. They <b>WILL</b> leak out,
        eventually, even if yours looks fine - but probably yours has started
        leaking already, if you have such a battery.
      </p>
      <p>
        Luckily my 486GR and my friend's CE2's do not have those batteries;
        they use a rechargeable lithium coin cell instead. If yours has a
        NiCad barrel cell, though, clip it off at once, wipe some vinegar
        around where it was, followed by some alcohol to get the vinegar off.
        (&hellip;NiCad's <i>are</i> alkalinic, right??)
      </p>
      <p>
        Anyway, if the corrosion hasn't crept far from the battery's spot on
        the board, you are lucky. Sand the corrosion off to expose good
        copper, repair traces if corrosion has left no good copper behind in
        those spots. After some alcohol cleaning, <b>let it dry</b> and then
        paint over the exposed copper with nail polish or similar to replace
        the solder resist which used to cover the copper that you removed.
        Then, get a new NiCad cell - but solder wires into the
        main board where the battery used to be, and mount the battery itself
        somewhere on the casing or otherwise isolated from the PCB as much as
        possible. That way, when it leaks next time, it hopefully won't pour
        its copper-eating contents all over the circuit board.
      </p>
      <p>
        If your corrosion is bad, you may need to do more intensive sanding
        and scrubbing and soldering, or perhaps even just replace the board.
        Hopefully, you won't have to do that.
      </p>
      <p>
        As mentioned in a previous section, the other thing that can cause
        corrosion is capacitors leaking. This is by far the most common with
        old surface mount capacitors; many PC-9801-86 sound cards seem to have
        leaked capacitors which leave this sort of blue-green residue on the
        board. This stuff is nowhere near as caustic as the NiCad battery
        leakage, but it's still <i>definitely</i> not a good thing. If your PC
        has these (my 486GR does not, nor do my friend's Ce2's and Cs2), and
        you see leakage or your computer is acting weird, then get a hot air
        station as soon as possible and remove all the surface mount caps
        (after documenting where the caps were, what their capacitances were,
        and what their voltage ratings were). Buy new caps and put them on.
        Early surface mount capacitors just kind of sucked in pretty much
        everything people put them in.
      </p>
      <p>
        Desolder the caps in a well ventilated area!!! - the smell is awful.
        The electrolyte, when heated up sufficiently, smells of bad fish.
        No; I am not kidding. It truly is a 'fish' smell!
      </p>
      <p>
        Once desoldered, clean off board of residue again (I forget once again
        if the electrolyte is alkalinic or not... either jump straight to the
        alcohol, consider deploying the vinegar first if appropriate). You
        will probably find that soldering surface mount caps is easier than
        desoldering them.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>I do NOT recommend</b> that you desolder the surface mount caps
        with a regular iron. <i>Maybe</i> it's possible - but all I've
        succeeded in doing that way is ripping up traces at least half of the
        time.
      </p>
      <p>
        Hopefully, if your PC is not a laptop/notebook model, and it's old
        enough to use a 486 CPU or older, then it won't be using many (if any)
        surface mount caps. I don't know how common the problem is on PC-98's,
        but it impacted a lot of later Amiga models for sure, as well as
        X68000's and possibly FM Towns computers. I have a friend with two
        Amiga 4000's; one still needs recapping. (Wish he'd just let me have
        the damn thing.) Sega's Game Gear is also rather famous for pretty much
        <i>universally</i> needing all new capacitors at this point.
      </p>
      <p>
        I think Nintendo's Game Boy used some SMD caps on the CPU board, if
        I remember correctly... but for some reason, I haven't noticed leakage
        there yet. If so, then that's curious. I could of course be wrong,
        and conflating it with the later consoles like the Game Boy Pocket or
        Game Boy Color - by which point surface mount caps had seemingly
        improved somewhat.
      </p>
      <p>
        I sort of expect this won't be a problem for most of you, except for
        maybe if you go for a very late PC-98 or have some problematic
        expansion cards.
      </p>
      <p><a href="#pc9801_buying_wyatt_toc">[Top]</a></p>
      <h4>Case Corrosion</h4>
      <p>
        This is by far the lesser of two evils. If it isn't getting worse, you
        an probably leave it alone. Or, if it's not too far advanced and you
        feel a little brave, you could maybe even try to remove it yourself.
        I've never tried on a PC, but I don't see why what I'm about to discuss
        wouldn't work the same as it did on my last car (a 1993 Volvo 240
        wagon).
      </p>
      <p>
        You could probably just go to an auto parts store and buy some prepping
        chemical like what's used to clean rust off of a surface before
        painting POR-15 or similar protectants onto an area of a car body. The
        prepping stuff is <i>nasty;</i> be sure you don't let it get on your
        hands. Wear thick rubber gloves. Seriously. You'll probably be sorry if
        you don't.
      </p>
      <p>
        I think the one I used was POR-15 branded, but basically you just want
        a solvent that can dissolve rust and leaves the good steel behind. You
        don't need the special paint itself (the thing they tell you to paint
        on once all your prep work is done on your car) if you aren't planning
        on sticking your computer it in a swamp or other humid area afterwards.
      </p>
      <p>
        But that stuff will absolutely <i>chew</i> through rust. If the rust
        hasn't penetrated the metal, then it could be worth a shot. Just be
        aware that if the rust <i>has</i> penetrated all the way through the
        case, the prepping agent will tunnel a nice little hole right through
        the steel where the rust spot used to be.
      </p>
      <p>
        If it's just surface rust, though (it likely will be, since computers
        don't usually get as much exposure to adverse weather and salt as
        cars), then you can absolutely try it. It was really cool when I did
        it on my car to just watch the rust disappear and leave the gray steel
        behind. If someone other than the POR-15 company sells it, they
        probably sell the prepping agent cheaper, so definitely look around
        before buying any. Don't just take my advice as a plug for that brand.
        I just bought what was readily available locally.

      </p>
      <p>This site contains a comprehensive list of most if not all PC-98
        models (including Epson clones) released in Japan. It also contains
        system specifications, information on model variants (information like
        how the PC-486GR<b>2</b> came with no hard drive, or what OS a
        computer came installed with). It will also tell you information like
        how much RAM the computer can be upgraded to use, how much RAM it
        shipped with, the release date, and oftentimes even the dimensions of
        the case and weight (which is handy to know for purposes of estimating
        shipping costs).
      </p>
      <p>
        It is also useful for checking if a PC-98 model you are thinking of
        buying contains undesirable chips on the circuit board, like a Windows
        focused accelerator (if you want DOS games, you don't probably want
        this).

      <p>
        This is a great site if you are technically minded or are looking for
        things like electrical diagrams. It goes into a lot of detail on a lot
        of things, and has some pages in English (but most are in Japanese).
      </p>
      <p>
        I'd say that if I had to pick one site to find technical details of
        the PC-98 architecture itself, this would be it. It even explains
        details that would be useful if writing an assembly program for the
        PC-98, as well as details that would be useful if you were to try to
        write an OS.
      </p>
      <p>
        It probably holds the most value for programmers, but you don't have to
        be an OS developer to get useful information from the site. It just has
        generally useful info, like how to add memory. If you have to tinker
        with the hardware, it's just worth a look. Especially if you're
        thinking of making your own external floppy drive enclosure/adapter or
        similar.

        This page was a gem for me. It's the only place I've seen any of the
        on-board jumper settings for the Epson PC-486GR and relatives
        described. It looks like the models differ mainly in CPU installed,
        but also have jumpers differently configured to accept more memory.
        Additionally, the 486GF needs to have its 32MHz clock crystal replaced
        with a 50MHz one if you want to turn it into a 486GR!

        I am not sure on the full details of what this site actually is, but I
        was able to successfully use it to find some information on the pinouts
        of my floppy disk drives and some other connectors on my Epson. It has
        a lot of pinouts listed for parts of the PC-98 platform computers in
        general.

        Contains nearly anything you'd want to know about repairing a
        PC-9801-86 "86 sound" card/board. It seems a lot of them if not all of
        them have surface mount capacitors, and they like to leak and destroy
        everything. Recapping (replacing capacitors) often fixes these issues.
        Contains a list of all the capacitor values and ratings that you will
        need to do the job. Note that this job is much easier with a hot air
        station, and much less likely to result in ripping pads off the board.

        This is just a one-off blog post, as far as I know, but there's a
        chance they have other posts, too.
      </p>
      <p>
        This person's blog post helped me to understand how to make a floppy
        disk work on a PC-98. Even if you are just preparing western
        IBM-formatted floppy disks so that your PC-98 can read and write them,
        or are trying to copy files to the PC-98, it's good information to
        know.
      </p>
      <p>
        In brief, some 3.5" floppy drives can run at 360 RPM - many USB ones,
        but not as many internal western ones, if any. The PC-98 traditionally
        used 360 RPM, even for 3.5" disks. In this mode of operation, a 3.5"
        diskette is accessed exactly like a 5.25" diskette, as far as the drive
        or computer is concerned. But for this to work, your floppy must first
        be <i>sectored and formatted</i> as if it were a 5.25" disk. Most
        western 3.5" floppy disks will not be from the factory - they'll be
        IBM formatted, which for high density floppies means 300 RPMs and
        1.44 megabytes of data instead of 360 RPMs and 1.2 megabytes. If your
        drive and software supports it, you can transform an IBM formatted
        floppy into a PC98 formatted one. Also, some later PC-9821's (perhaps
        1993 or 1994 onwards) can natively handle 300 RPM 1.44 megabyte
        diskettes in addition to their historical 360RPM DD and HD formats.

        This one covers a bunch of things, most prominently translations of the

        They might vary a little for yours, but especially if you have an

        This one is an invaluable resource, since the hard disk initialization
        process isn't quite the same as the one you may be used to from western
        DOS. Someone's gone to the trouble of taking lots of screenshots
        to guide you through initializing and formatting a fresh HDD for
        booting DOS from. It saved me a lot of time. It specifically is
        describing the process in NEC MS-DOS 6.2 (which can also be run and
        installed on an Epson PC-98; it doesn't have the "Epson Check" sabotage
        some earlier versions of NEC MS-DOS do).

      <p>
        Can't find what you're looking for above? Here's some words that might
        be handy to put into search engines. For the "how to type" row,
        I am using the "romaji typing method" in Anthy on Linux, but I think
        it should work similarly on Windows with Microsoft's input method
        editor. Also, the spaces in the "how to type" field are merely there
        to aid in mapping the keystrokes to the individual japanese
        characters. If kanji are involved, you will need to press 'space'
        after inputting that group of characters and select your kanji.
      </p>
      <p>
        This maybe wouldn't be necessary if typing the hepburn pronunciation
        worked. But 'small kana' and such have to be entered differently.
      </p>
      <p>
        A '&#8251;' character (Japanese reference mark) means I was too
        ignorant and/or lazy to figure out how to type something. Sorry in
        advance. In such cases, if a typing guide is still provided, it means
        that it was my best attempt and it came close or sort of worked but
        added extra junk characters.
      </p>
      <p>
        I just include it in the hopes that it may help someone who is trying
        to learn Japanese - even if many or all of the words here are just
        katakana transliterations of English.
