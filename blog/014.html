          This mac is being worked on in my own time, and is not yet revived.
          I plan to update this page as progress is made, adding more photos
          and descriptions as needed.

        I recently came into ownership of a free Macintosh Centris 650. A guy
        living across the street had a yard sale, and I saw this Macintosh
        with a monitor, mouse, and keyboard inside of his garage. It wasn't
        intended to be part of the sale, but I still asked how much he wanted
        for it, and he told me I could have it for free and that it did not
        currently work.
      </p>
      <p>
        Knowing nothing about old macs, I thought "Well, it can't be TOO bad,
        can it?" and decided to take it. The previous owner also told me that
        he had some writing saved on it, and I offered to try to rescue it for
        him; he agreed. So maybe, if the Quantum hard disk works when I get
        to that point, he'll be getting his old files back.
      </p>
      <p>
        The physical condition of the mac looked "not bad," as far as I was
        concerned.

      </div>
      <p>
        &hellip;But sometimes, looks can be deceiving, as we will soon see!
      </p>
      <h2>Cleaning it Up</h2>
      <p>
        The first thing I always do when I get old electronics (or even
        secondhand non-electronics) is to clean them up. I've had a case before
        where the simple act of cleaning off the motherboard caused a seemingly
        dead Nintendo 64 to start working, and it's also good for my health
        to not be breathing in all that old garage dust.
      </p>
      <h3>Cleaning the Keyboard</h3>
      <p>
        I did the keyboard first, since if I got the mac working and still
        have to clean the keyboard I might put off cleaning the keyboard
        indefinitely. Taking it apart, the keyboard was no big deal. It was
        held together mostly by screws; compared to a modern Apple product,
        especially, it was quite straightforward. I popped the keycaps off,
        scrubbed them, and put them back on. Meanwhile, I soaked the case
        plastic in warm water to loosen the dirt stuck on it.
      </p>
      <div class="imgcontain imgwrap" id="centris-keyboard-1">
        <a href="centris_1/full/centris_keyboard_cleaned.jpg">
          <img src="centris_1/centris_keyboard_cleaned.jpg"
               alt="The Apple Keyboard II sitting on my desk, now cleaned."/>
        </a>
        <div class="imgwrap caption imgcentercaption">
          The legends on some keys are wearing off, but apart from that, the keyboard looks quite dashing.<br/>
          It never ceases to amaze me what a difference just a simple scrubbing can make!
        </div>
      </div>
      <p>
        I then tested the keyboard out with an ADB to USB adapter, which I
        already had lying around on account of the Apple Extended Keyboard that
        I got back in 2018 or so. Everything works just like it should! The key
        feel isn't anything fantastic&hellip; It bottoms out a little harder
        than many regular rubber dome boards, but it still uses buckling rubber
        sleeves for tactile feedback so some of the "rubber dome" feel is still
        definitely present. One nice thing is that the key doesn't quite have
        to bottom out to register&hellip; But my Apple Extended board from
        1987 or so still feels better so I'll probably use that if I can get
        the computer working.
      </p>
      <h3>Cleaning the Computer</h3>
      <p>
        I skipped the monitor and mouse for now; I've done the mouse but I
        didn't take any pictures yet. I'll maybe come back to it later. The
        monitor still needs cleaning as of this writing, but I'm fairly
        confident that it will not be <i>too</i> bad.
      </p>
      <p>
        I next took the case apart for the Centris itself. It was quite dusty
        inside&hellip; who knows how long it sat in that garage.
      </p>
      <div class="imgcontain imgwrap" id="centris-inside-case-1">

        </a>
        <div class="imgwrap caption imgcentercaption">
          My initial view upon opening the case. Tons of dust!&ndash; The Motorola 68040 CPU is under the heat sink.
        </div>
      </div>
      <p>
        One good thing I noticed was a lack of aluminum electrolytic surface
        mount capacitors; Apple seems to have used tantalum caps, which have
        much better characteristics&hellip; except that when they fail they
        like to catch fire. But at least they don't tend to leak out liquid
        capacitor electrolyte (an acid) all over everything. So I've got that
        going for me, which is nice.
      </p>
      <p>
        There was a thick layer of dust on the motherboard, but that's not in
        and of itself a deal breaker. It did get me hoping that <i>maybe</i>
        I'd just have to give the board a good cleaning and it might clear
        some short, letting the computer start working.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, this notion was quickly abandoned, when I removed the hard
        drive and floppy drive mounting plate&hellip; and found the stuff that
        my nightmares are made of.

                    slot. There are also smaller splatters that hit the main
                    RAM expansion stick slot area and various other parts,

        Yes, the real-time clock battery had exploded. Or leaked very, very
        badly and somehow flung acid out so that it rained over part of the
        board.
      </p>
      <p>
        I'd been lucky so far; I'd only seen bad battery leakage once before
        in my life, when it had ruined my Amiga 500's RAM expansion board.

      <p>
        In that case, I was able to sidestep the issue, since the expansion
        card was enclosed in sheet metal and the battery was not on the
        motherboard itself. The Amiga also had some unused spots on the main
        board that I was able to solder RAM into, totally obviating the need
        for the expansion slot except for the real-time clock (which I can live
        without or make my own modification for). Even the leakage in that,
        though, was nothing compared to the carnage I was witnesing here.
      </p>
      <p>
        The battery had left a soupy mixture of rust and lithium-based battery
        acid that was destroying everything in its path. It wasn't a slow
        trickle followed by creeping corrosion in the traces; it was a dam
        bursting open and flooding the poor unsuspecting village below.
      </p>
      <p>
        To many, this would be a complete and instant game-over. I still as of
        writing this am not <i>certain</i> that I can save this computer. But
        darn it, I got this for free! - So I <i>have</i> to try. If I can get
        it going, I can both have a 68040-based mac and also run NetBSD on
        it!&ndash; For much cheaper than any Amiga capable of doing the same.
        And even if I end up giving up and just replacing a motherboard, it
        will cost less than buying an A4000.
      </p>
      <h3>Rescuing a Battery-Bombed Macintosh</h3>
      <p>
        Since I was determined to save this thing, regardless of how much it
        clearly wanted to be dead, I began by trying to clean up the flooded
        "canals" of battery acid. The first step was removing the battery.
        I then used dry cotton swabs to try to mop up the battery acid that was
        still in liquid form. Then, i soaked the area in isopropyl alcohol.
      </p>
      <div class="imgcontain imgwrap" id="centris-battery-cleanup-1">

               alt="The circuit board after mopping up the liquid battery acid
                    that I could reach with cotton swabs. There's still lots
                    of little rust fragments on the board and some crusty
                    dried deposits, but remarkably the silkscreen is still
                    good on the board (meaning the chips' labels are still
                    intact on the circuit board)"/>
        </a>
        <div class="imgwrap caption imgcentercaption">
          Surprisingly, the silkscreen for the board seems fully intact despite
          the massive flooding.
        </div>
      </div>
      <p>
        Now let's take a moment to assess what might be damaged.
      </p>
      <p>
        The area immediately around the battery contains the real time
        clock and PRAM, which are both inside the "VLSI" chip with pins on all
        four sides. It also where Apple decided it'd be good to solder down
        all of the system's built-in main RAM. All sixteen of those Motorola
        "MCM44400N80" chips constitute the computer's main working memory. This
        can be further extended by adding sticks in the black RAM slots to the
        left of these chips. One of those slots was <i>also</i> splashed by
        battery acid and Needs to be removed. The VRAM slots (an uncommon
        68-pin SIMM variant) are also attacked by acid and need to be taken
        out. As we will eventually see, this will be quite tricky due to
        <i>the solder itself</i> being degraded by the battery acid.
      </p>
      <p>
        In a way, this is actually a kind of the best part of the board to get
        destroyed, because it means the only custom chip that I need to worry
        about being destroyed is the PRAM/RTC hybrid chip. The rest is
        commodity dynamic RAM (DRAM), which even though it's been out of
        production for many years is still easy to obtain online. It's the
        same kinds of chips that were used in many IBM PC compatibles and even
        non-IBM compatibles used from that period. In fact, I think my Epson
        PC-486GR uses the same or very similar chips, and I know for sure that
        my friend's PC-9821Ce2 and Cs2 computers use them, too. So soldering
        them all down without a hot air station will actually be a trickier
        problem than getting the chips.
      </p>
      <p>
        I saw an ebay listing for forty compatible RAM chips from Toshiba in
        their original factory packaging for $25, for instance. Not too bad at
        all, even on a shoestring budget. This is "Fast Page Mode" (FPM) DRAM;
        do not get EDO DRAM or it will likely not work.
      </p>
      <p>
        Miraculously, in addition to the silkscreen on the board remaining intact,
        even the traces still look okay and are visible underneath the
        solder-resist, which is the green film layer that protects the traces
        during the soldering process. Often with battery leakage, corrosion
        creeps down below the solder resist and wipes the traces out from
        beneath.
      </p>
      <p>
        The next step was using alcohol-drenched cotton swabs to clean up
        whatever mess was still left.
      </p>
      <div class="imgcontain imgwrap" id="centris-battery-cleanup-2">
        <a href="centris_1/full/centris_battery_cleanup_02.jpg">

               alt="The board now looks wetter than before due to alcohol,
                    but most of the rust particles are cleaned up and the
                    traces are quite plainly visible. It actually looks...
                    well, not horrible."/>
        </a>
        <div class="imgwrap caption imgcentercaption">
          It's looking much better now&hellip; <br/>
          but battery acid still lurks underneath the RAM slots and the
          sixteen DRAM chips themselves.
        </div>
      </div>
      <p>
        Since there was still battery acid underneath the chips, and the RAM
        slots for that matter, I needed to figure out what to do about that. I
        knew there was probably no way I could avoid desoldering the chips to
        properly clean under them. This is quite problematic&ndash; primarily
        because I have no hot air station (and surface mount desoldering with
        an iron and wick is not fun at all). The other issue is that soldering
        them back down without the correct iron tip is a challenge to say the
        least, and I'm about to ruin my only "proper" iron tip doing something
        else to this Macintosh (we will probably get to that soon).
      </p>
      <p>
        But before I desoldered the chips, there were two last things I wanted
        to try to clean up the board. One was removing the battery holder so I
        could clean up under it; the other was something sort of unorthodox
        but which I had a feeling could work decently.
      </p>

          One of the pins on the holder had actually been eaten through!!
        </div>
      </div>
      <p>
        With that removed, I did a little scrubbing with cotton swabs again,
        and then was ready to try my next trick&hellip; something I had never
        done before.

        Guess what? it worked great. I soaked it in alcohol again after using
        the flosser on it, since the alcohol can help the water to evaporate
        faster, and then let the board dry off with a fan blowing air on it
        overnight. When I came back the next day, it looked <i>markedly</i>
        better.

        Next, I had to stop beating around the bush and try to remove all of
        the chips. I have no hot air station (which just blows super hot air
        on the board to melt the solder on all the pins of a chip at once to
        allow removal), so I had to improvise.
      </p>
      <p>
        This is the kind of job I had for a very long time said "I'll do it
        later when I have the right tools." I have a SNES that I think I can
        fix if I can obtain the correct ones, for instance. And an NEC
        PC-9801-86 sound card (with a Yamaha YM2608 Frequency Modulated (FM)
        synthesizer chip). But since tools were not forthcoming, I decided I
        needed to bite the bullet on this one.
      </p>
      <p>
        A friend of mine with similar interests living in France that I spoke
        with on both IRC and Fediverse (mastodon <i>et al</i>) told me to try
        flooding one side of the chip with solder and melting it all, then
        bending that side of the chip up and doing the other.
      </p>
      <p>
        It seemed as good an idea as any, although it's complicated by the fact
        that there's a large gap between pins 5 and "9" (I'd call it "pin 6,"
        but the datasheet and schematic both skip pins 6, 7, and 8). To avoid
        this, I flooded each side independently and used my second soldering
        iron to melt the second set of pins, prying up with both irons.
      </p>
      <p>
        This is something you should try to avoid on boards that might already
        have pads and traces weakened by battery acid, but because this is RAM
        specifically it is separated out into "buses" that make it so the
        nearby chips share a lot of wiring with each other and most signals
        can easily be grabbed from them.
      </p>
      <p>
        Actually, i also discovered that three of the chips had already had
        <i>each and every pin and almost every pad on one side</i> eaten away
        before I began, which made things a little easier for desoldering.

          Lots of battery acid under there, too! Good thing I'm taking these off to clean&hellip;

      <p>
        In any case, my technique basically worked. I think most or all of the
        damaged pins were already gone due to battery acid; all of the five
        chips that have all pads intact after removal are the ones that the
        acid didn't land on or otherwise touch.
      </p>
      <p>
        If anyone's wondering though, yes, this means just a water flosser is
        unlikely to be able to get all the acid off!

        After all of them are removed, it's time for a damage assessment. Five
        chips' worth of pads are completely unscathed. Apple's Quadra 800 and
        Centris 650 used the same motherboard, and the schematic for them
        shows that some configurations of Centris 650 shipped with only eight
        soldered-down RAM chips. All five of the undamaged chip pads are on
        the correct side for a 4MB factory configuration, mercifully! - so I
        might only solder eight chips back down to save myself some work and
        at least verify that the system still can have a pulse.

          It looks much cleaner now, although it's going to be a headache
          wiring it all back up. And the corroded SIMM slots still need
