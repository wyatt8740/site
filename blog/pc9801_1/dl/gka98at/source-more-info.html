    <title>GKA-98AT Keyboard Converter Information</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <p>
      This is a PC-98 to PS/2 keyboard converter based on a PIC16f84(a) or
      16f648a microcontroller. I found this stuff on:<br/>
      <a href="http://shinku.ddo.jp/wordpress/?page_id=4151">http://shinku.ddo.jp/wordpress/?page_id=4151</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      That page is worth a visit if you can get through the language barrier
      because it is a solid write-up and features a patch for a larger PIC
      model (16f648).

    <p>
      The <a href="http://www.tsp.ne.jp/~sawada/mago/c_gka98at.htm">original
        site</a> was down, and the asm file from that site was not archived by
      the wayback machine. However, the webpage the file was hosted on
      <i>was</i> archived
      (<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20210128190529/http://www.tsp.ne.jp/~sawada/mago/c_gka98at.htm">wayback machine link</a>).

      Hasu's <a href="https://github.com/tmk/tmk_keyboard/wiki/PC-9801-Keyboard">TMK
      keyboard firmware documentation for its own PC98 to USB keyboard
      converter implementation</a> references the original site, which is how I
      discovered the converter existed to begin with.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have not tried to build this converter, but I expect it works. I'd like
      to build one since I prefer PS/2 over USB keyboards anyway. But for now I
      have made a TMK converter which works.

      They (either kind of microcontroller) must be rated at least 10MHz. I
      think from the PDF maybe these are actually getting clocked at 6.144MHz
      via crystal? - But that might be changable to 10MHz in the source code. I
      did not look closely at all.
