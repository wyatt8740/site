    <title>GKA-AT98 Keyboard Converter Information</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <p>
      This is a PS/2 to PC-98 keyboard converter based on a PIC16f84(a) - or
      perhaps with changes a 16f648a microcontroller. See the "GKA-98AT" page
      for some references on how you might do that. I don't have pre-made
      patches for this one...
    </p>
    <p>
      The <a href="http://www.tsp.ne.jp/~sawada/mago/c_gkaat98.htm">original
        site</a> was down, and the asm file from that site was not archived by
      the wayback machine. However, the webpage the file was hosted on
      <i>was</i> archived
      (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190421112944/http://www.tsp.ne.jp/~sawada/mago/c_gkaat98.htm">wayback machine link</a>).
    </p>
    <p>
      I have not tried to build this converter, but I expect it works. I'd like
      to build one eventually since no complicated USB host device is needed
      for a PS/2 to 98 adapter.

      They (either kind of microcontroller) must be rated at least 10MHz. I
      think from the PDF maybe these are actually getting clocked at 6.144MHz
      via crystal? - But that might be changable to 10MHz in the source code. I
      did not look closely at all.

      You will have to edit the source code for your AT board's layout and
      personal preferences and PIC clock speed. But there you have it. You can
      find more info on
