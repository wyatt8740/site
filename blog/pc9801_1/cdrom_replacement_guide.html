      <h2>Replacing the CDR-260 Drive in a PC-9821 Ce2 or Cs2</h2>
      <p>
        It is relatively simple to modify certain CD-ROM drives to work in a
        PC-9821 Ce2/Cs2, but there are a few caveats. Firstly, a standard ATAPI
        CD-ROM drive will make the BIOS pause for about 60 seconds during boot
        and appear to hang. If you wait it out it will in fact continue,
        however. The drive also needs to be set to the "slave" position with
        jumpers, since it is actually sharing the same bus as the hard drive
        despite being plugged into a different motherboard connector. Not all
        drives will <i>physically</i> work, either. The tray needs to be small
        enough and positioned correctly to clear the hole in the front plate on
        the computer. There has to be a way to position the eject
        button such that it can be pressed, or else the front plate on the
        computer must be modified. It may be necessary to trim some
        plastic on the front plate so that it can clip in place, since the
        metal housing of the drive can interfere with it. The CD audio cable
        will need a new end spliced on, since the original drive doesn't use
        the common CD audio out connector for sound card mixing. Finally, the
        front "Compact Disc" logo plate might not be able to attach, so you
        will just have to deal with that or else modify that as well.
      </p>
      <p>
        This page doesn't currently cover splicing the audio cable or cutting
        the case plastic, mostly due to laziness and also because I never
        bothered splicing the audio cable before I fixed my CDR-260. The wiring
        is indicated on the back of the CDR-260 drive (I believe the left and
        right channels are on the left and right sides, and a single shared
        ground is on the middle pin of its three pin connector).
      </p>
      <p>
        Newer, higher-speed drives might also be quite loud compared to the
        original, but that might just be something you have to deal with unless
        you can find a PC-98 DOS specific program to send the "set CD speed"
        ATAPI command to the drive.
      </p>
      <p>
        My system does not currently have a replacement drive installed, since
        I was able to fix the original CDR-260 drive. 
      </p>
      <p>
        I had two IDE drives on hand, and only one of them has a tray that fits
        physically through the hole. In my case, this is an LG CRD-8483B. The
        following photos will help explain how I went about making the drive
        work.
      </p>

        </a>
        <div class="imgwrap caption imgcentercaption">
          Our victim ATAPI drive, LG CRD-8483B. Other models may also work.
          <br/>
          This is the only drive I have where the tray fits through the hole in
          the case (with the front plate removed).
        </div>
      </div>
      <p>
        The CRD-8483B seems to be an OEM CD drive, and I've seen one on eBay
        that has all faceplate I/O included. The ones that shipped with gateway
        computers only have an eject button, but others additionally have a
        "play" button, a volume potentiometer dial, and a headphone jack. It
        just so happens that the "play" button on those drives is in the exact
        right spot for the outer button mechanism in the PC-9821 Ce2 and Cs2 to
        be able to press it, so the main job here is taking the casing and
        front plates off of the drive and relocating the eject button to the
        position of the "play" button. We then need to make sure the button is
        still wired up to the eject signal on the circuit board, which requires
        cutting one trace and running a very short wire.
      </p>

      <p>
        The first thing we need to do is to eject the drive tray. I just hooked
        my drive up to an AT power supply and hit eject. You can use a working
        ATX power supply as well, but in order to power those up you will need to
        bridge the green wire pin and the neighboring black pin on the main
        motherboard connector. I use a paperclip for those typically. AT PSU's
        are entirely controlled by a user-operable switch, so they are quite
        convenient. You can also manually use a paperclip inserted into the tiny
        hole on the front plate of the drive to make it eject without powering it
        up.

          This is probably necessary to remove the front plastic panel pieces.
        </div>
      </div>
      <p>
        Next, I flipped the drive upside down, and removed the four screws in
        the bottom (the recessed ones; the non-recessed holes are drive
        mounting holes).

        <div class="imgwrap caption imgcentercaption">
          This is probably necessary to remove the front plastic panel pieces.
          <br/>
          On this drive, the bottom plastic clip did not move when pressed.
        </div>
      </div>
      <p>
        Next, we need to flip the drive on its side and press in the locking
        tab/clip pieces on the left and right that hold the front panel on. The
        bottom one does not like moving which is why we removed the screws in
        the bottom already.
      </p>

                    for the front plate."/>
        </a>
        <div class="imgwrap caption imgcentercaption">
          The side clips on this drive move freely, unlike the bottom one.
          <br/>
          That means we can begin to dislodge the faceplate by pressing these tabs down and pushing forward just a smidge.
        </div>
      </div>
      <p>
        Now, with the faceplate dislodged slightly, it's time to remove the
        bottom plate, effectively freeing the front panel's last clip.

        </a>
        <div class="imgwrap caption imgcentercaption">
          By lifting from the back, we can dislodge the bottom clip, freeing
          the front panel.

      </div>
      <p>
        Note that this drive's bottom casing has no insulation plastic or paper
        or anything on it, so when we are soldering later, be careful not to let
        stuff stick down too far.
      </p>
      <p>
        In any case, now the front panel is free and it's time to remove the
        decorative plate that is clipped to the end of the CD drive tray.
        One can see that on this particular drive, it was attached by sliding
        down over the front and then anchored in place by some clips on the
        underside to prevent accidental removal.
      </p>
      <div class="imgcontain imgwrap" id="pc9801_buying_wyatt_atapi_07">
        <a href="full/cdrom/atapi_drive_07.jpg">

        </a>
        <div class="imgwrap caption imgcentercaption">
          This lip piece of plastic on the front of the tray needs to come off.
          <br/>
          Note how it was slid into place originally and has clip tabs holding
          it there.
        </div>
      </div>
      <p>
        Now we need to pull the plastic lip out slightly in the center,
        bending the plastic somewhat. Hopefully yours is not brittle and will
        not be damaged by this. While it's pulled out, if the drive is still
        flipped upside down, we push the plastic downwards so that it slides
        off the tracks it was hooked in with.
      </p>
      <div class="imgcontain imgwrap" id="pc9801_buying_wyatt_atapi_08">

          when you slide it off.

      </div>
      <p>
        Now, we have the front panel loose and the front plastic "lip" on the
        tray removed. It is now possible to slide the front plastic panel off,
        unhindered by the tray lip.
      </p>

        <div class="imgwrap caption imgcentercaption">
          Slide off the front panel and store both the plastic tray lip and

          That way, you can reuse the drive with a "normal" PC again in the
          future.
        </div>
      </div>
      <p>
        Now let's remove the bottom metal panel completely if we haven't
        already, and then inspect the circuit board. You can see in the
        following photo a switch labelled "SW704", and a few holes next to an
        unpopulated spot labelled "SW703." Our goal now is to relocate SW704 to
        the holes that were provided for SW703 (the "play" button).
      </p>

        </a>
        <div class="imgwrap caption imgcentercaption">
          There are lots of unpopulated components that would likely be
          included on a more "fully featured" drive.
          <br/>
          Thankfully, the unused "play" button is perfectly positioned for the
          eject button lever thing on the faceplate of the PC-9821 Ce2/Cs2.
        </div>
      </div>
      <p>
        Now, let's look at the underside. I've already done this mod and undid
        it and then re-did it again to take photos, so there's some brownish
        black spots from burned flux residue and similar. A trace has also
        already been cut in this photo that you will need to cut yourself.
      </p>
      <div class="imgcontain imgwrap" id="pc9801_buying_wyatt_atapi_11">
        <a href="full/cdrom/atapi_drive_11.jpg">

                    as well as what looks like spots for a potentiometer dial
                    and a headphone jack to be soldered on."/>
        </a>
        <div class="imgwrap caption imgcentercaption">
          The cut trace on the CD drive here near the left hand side can be
          anywhere on that trace, if that makes you feel more comfortable.
          <br/>
          We will be remapping that wire to hook to the other button spot's
          equivalent pin and transplanting the existing button itself.
        </div>
      </div>
      <p>
        Looking more closely at the board we can see where the traces lead; if
        preferred, one can also just unsolder the wire lead connecting this
        board to the other board for the play button. This way, no cutting of
        traces is hopefully needed. Whatever method you use, use a continuity
        tester when you think you are done to make sure the trace is actually
        cut through - and also that its neighbours still work correctly.
      </p>

        <div class="imgwrap caption imgcentercaption">
          I don't even know if the other button would work normally if no
          action were taken, but I suspect it would.
        </div>
      </div>
      <p>
        We need to remove the solder from the holes for the eventual
        destination of the button. This can be done with wick or a pump. I used
        a spring loaded pump.
      </p>
      <div class="imgcontain imgwrap" id="pc9801_buying_wyatt_atapi_13">

        </a>
        <div class="imgwrap caption imgcentercaption">
          You can also try to just melt the solder and stick the legs in one by
          one later, but I do not recommend that.
        </div>
      </div>
      <p>
        We also need to remove the solder on the motor to be able to lift the
        board up, I think. And release the black clip next to the motor
        afterwards.
      </p>
      <div class="imgcontain imgwrap" id="pc9801_buying_wyatt_atapi_15">

        <div class="imgwrap caption imgcentercaption">
          Remember to release the black clip! It is easy to forget, at least
          for me.
        </div>
      </div>
      <p>
        Now, we need to desolder the old button (I used a spring loaded pump
        again), and move it to the new position. We then solder a small wire to
        the pin we cut the trace for on one side and the original eject
        button's spot on the other.
      </p>
      <div class="imgcontain imgwrap" id="pc9801_buying_wyatt_atapi_16">

        </a>
        <div class="imgwrap caption imgcentercaption">
          Make sure it's slim, so the case will still close without shorting to
          the wire!
        </div>
      </div>
      <p>
        Next we clip the circuit board back into place and re-solder the motor
        pins, and then we're done. We can now re-assemble the drive. Other
        things that might be a good idea include making a wire adapter for the
        audio line output, since the PC-9821 Ce2/Cs2 models use a different
        connector for it, and cutting notches into the front faceplate for the
        Ce2 so that the drive shell doesn't stop it from clipping on properly.
        These are not yet covered here.

        Be sure not to put the drive's front faceplate or tray lip back on
        unless you remove the modification to the button and revert it. It will
        not fit in any way unless this is removed. If you want to keep the
        original "Compact Disc" front lip that matches the Ce2 you will have to
        modify it as well. I did not bother, since I was able to fix my
        original drive eventually.

        Also don't forget that this drive will cause the PC-98 to pause for
        approximately 60 seconds during boot, probably waiting for some reply
        that the CDR-260 would make that this drive is not making. After that,
        the drive will work in DOS if the <code>NECCDM.SYS</code> driver is
        loaded, as well as <code>MSCDEX</code>. You may want to just back up
        <code>NECCD.SYS</code> and then copy <code>NECCDM.SYS</code> to
        <code>NECCD.SYS</code> so that other badly written software will behave
        properly.

        Unfortunately, I have not yet been able to send the ATAPI CD speed
        command to make the drive run quieter. It is possible, but I just lack
        the knowledge to do it right now.
