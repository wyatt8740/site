      <p>
        A while ago now (November 2017, at latest), I got a 1.33GHz
        aluminum PowerBook G4 (model A1095) from a HAM radio convention. I
        pretty much instantly regretted my impulsive buy (since I saw something
        else that I also wanted and didn't have the cash on-hand anymore), but
        no refunds. So I brought it home.
      </p>
      <p>The following is a partial story of my journey with this machine.
        I've since discovered what it can do, as well as its limitations, and
        I'm not quite so regretful of my purchase anymore. This laptop has
        yielded some great learning experiences for me with respect to
        hardware and software, and also made me more mindful of good software
        design principles.
      </p>
      <p>Note also that much of the stuff I am writing about was done a year or
        more ago, and is therefore likely to have accidental omissions, and
        possibly actual inaccuracies as well. I just think it's been a kind of
        fun project to get this thing on its feet, and that maybe other people
        could benefit or possibly even be entertained by the story.
      </p>
      <h3>First Impressions/Hardware Summary: </h3>
<!--      <p>
        It is impossible for me to talk about apple hardware without first
        disclosing my general opinion on the company itself. If you don't care,
        you can skip the following subsection and move straight on to the
        actual review.
      </p>-->
      <p>
        First, I should acknowledge that even if their software is nice, I've
        never really "loved" Apple <i>hardware</i> the way I love my old
        Thinkpads or Nintendo consoles. That is mainly because I'm the kind of
        person who impulsively tears down every bit of kit I get within about a
        week of the acquisition. But Apple doesn't like people to do that. And
        to me, trying to scare away inquisitive people who want to know how
        things work is really a weird tactic for a company that supposedly
        needs engineers to survive. To me, a product that I'm supposed to
        treat as a black box is a product I don't really get to use to its
        fullest.
      </p>
<!--     <p>
        No, as much as people talk about Apple products being spiffy or
        whatnot, I have the distinct feeling that if Apple were to suddenly
        just start churning out beige boxes again, one of three things would
        happen.
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>Beige enters vogue again across the entire computer industry.</li>
        <li>It doesn't enter vogue again, but Apple sells about as many of
          these they always would. </li>
        <li>
          There is a temporary lull in sales. In a few years, sales skyrocket.
        </li>
        <ul>
          <li>When Apple drops support for the older aluminum machines, I
            assert that people WILL buy the beige boxes as their computers
            reach obsolescence. This is because if the software itself feels
            the same, and the app ecosystem hasn't changed, that's what most
            people care about, more than aesthetics.</li>
          <li>
            Is that naïve of me? ...Probably. But, given that Apple has
            survived multiple architectural changes, usually dropping support
            for the old platform only a few (maybe three) years after
            introducing the new one, and people keep buying in, I don't think
            most people really care much. Apple also did this with the
            headphone jack deletion on the iPhone 6. But if there's only one
            model on the market, there's only one choice.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </ol>
      <p>
        I think point 3 is more likely (<i>after all, people don't buy with
        their eyes, right, guys?</i> I hope we don't do it that badly).
        This is because Apple's real product (at least in the desktop/laptop
        segments) isn't its hardware anymore. I don't think it ever was,
        because the first macs cost much more than an Amiga 1000 and did
        much less than an Amiga 1000. It was the software experience the
        macintosh offered that primarily made the original mac sell. 
      </p>
      <p>
        I think if I were buying a new computer today, it would likely be a
        MacBook (or a Panasonic Let's Note, imported from Japan, but that's
        another topic entirely). Windows 10 is not an operating system I like,
        so if I weren't going to go the Free Software route I'd almost
        certainly pick something running Mac OS.
      </p>-->
      <p>
        But yeah, There's a big reason I bought this powerbook. For fun! Isn't
        that best reason to do something? So, I was prepared for the challenges
        dealing with Apple products tend to incur. First, let's look at the
        hardware a bit.
      </p>
      <p>
        I am still ambivalent about this 'book overall (having had to open it
        up and at one point remove the entire motherboard from the chassis to
        reach the power jack), but I am at the very least now convinced that
        Apple in ~2004 was a very different company than it is today. There are
        several things that exemplify this, but some of the most prevalent are:
        <br/>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Standard computer I/O ports:</li>
        <ul>
          <li>3x USB 2.0 ports</li>
          <li>1x full-size gigabit ethernet port</li>
          <li>1x TV-Out connector (7-pin Mini-DIN or variant, also found on
            other computers of the period)</li>
          <li>2x IEEE 1394 "firewire" ports (FW400 and FW800)</li>
          <li>1x modem connector</li>
          <li>2x 3.5mm TRS jacks, for audio output and a microphone</li>
          <li>1x <i>dual-link</i> DVI-I connector</li>
          <li>1x cardbus expansion slot(!)</li>
        </ul>
        <li>A <i>fantastic feeling</i> keyboard (though there are still some
          issues):</li>
        <ul>
          <li>Missing navigational keys, insert key, print screen key (not
            a huge issue in OS X, but convenient in other OSes)</li>
          <li>the F* keys are not spaced out into quads, so blindly reaching
            for them isn't as easy as it is on a classic Thinkpad</li>
          <li>No way to distinguish between left and right 'command' keys.
            They both send the same keycode. I think this might be a legacy of
            the Apple Desktop Bus (ADB) which they use, since my Apple Extended
            Keyboard (1987) also does this.</li>
        </ul>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Note that the dual-link DVI connector is superior to Apple's later
        proprietary Mini-DVI in that it supplies far higher video resolutions.
        Apple took a step back and downgraded to 1920x1200 @ 60hz maximum when
        they moved to mini-DVI. The only dongle I can imagine needing on this
        machine would be a passive DVI-I to VGA adapter, if connecting the
        laptop to a CRT or similar. These are widely available and not
        Apple-exclusive; I have at least three. Apple sure doesn't build them
        like they used to.
      </p>
      <p>
        Some other specs of this machine include a 1280x854 TFT LCD (of pretty
        good quality and a nice aspect ratio), a Motorola/Freescale PowerPC
        7447a CPU (7450 derivative) with the Altivec SIMD instruction set,
        an ATI Mobility Radeon 9700 GPU (connected via AGP; there's a hardware
        bug with this that I'll try to get to later in the post), and initially
        (I believe) 512MB of DDR SDRAM. One of the first things I did was
        upgrading it to 2GB of RAM (its maximum amount).
      </p>
      <p>I also replaced the battery pack with an aftermarket one almost
        immediately, since the original Apple one was toast and my charger plug
        is slightly bent/messed up. If the plug comes out or twists too much,
        the machine will lose power, and since the battery was totally
        ineffective that meant instantly and abruptly turning off. My
        particular aftermarket battery didn't quite sit flush with the bottom
        of the laptop's chassis, so I put a strip of silver duct tape around
        the edge of it to stop the thin aluminum plate on the bottom from
        scraping against surfaces.
      </p>
      <p>Probably the single most major issue with the Powerbook (especially
        if not running OS X on it) is its single-button touchpad. This can be
        worked around; I'll try to remember to mention it when I get to writing
        about running Debian Linux on it.
      </p>
      <p>There's also an intermittent problem I've had with the real-time clock
        (and PRAM) battery, which makes me think it probably needs replacing;
        I'll get to that eventually, but it's not a very big deal since I can
        synchronize its clock with my other machines pretty easily. It uses a
        rechargeable Panasonic CGL3032 Li-ion coin cell soldered to a
        small daughterboard with tabs.

      </span>
      </div>
      <p>
        Since the original board assembly (part # 820-1686 or 820-1686-A) is
        apparently hard to find and often unavailable on ebay, etc., and the
        Panasonic coin cell in question is no longer in production, I'll
        probably end up ordering a similar cell I found on Digikey. Since
        that battery doesn't have solder tabs and I don't have equipment
        to weld them (risky), I'll either have to try taping it down, finding a
        battery clip that fits in the gap in the board, or throwing caution
        to the wind, sanding down the coin cell's sides (to create a rough
        texture), and soldering the tabs from the old battery onto it.</p>
      <p>
        I've done that before with alkaline cells, although I don't like doing
        it at all, and I'm always afraid I'll injure myself some day doing it.
        I'm not sure I want to risk it with an Li-ion cell, so for now I've
        just resigned myself to keeping the existing battery in here until
        I stop being able to ignore it.
      </p>
      <h3>Software: Getting Rolling</h3>
      <p>
        At the time I bought the machine, I think it was running
        OS X 10.4 (Tiger) or 10.5 (Leopard), but I only booted it into OS X
        once or twice on it before diving deeper. To me, at least, there's
        almost zero reason to run such an outdated OS X version on these
        macs, since the Apple ecosystem makes finding software that is still
        compatible with it difficult at best, and even building source code
        for it sounds painful due to the age of the official Apple toolchain.
      </p>
      <p>
        Thus, I quickly decided to put Debian on it. I chose Debian primarily
        because it's my distro of choice on my x86 desktop and laptop, but
        also because it actually had
        <a href="https://www.debian.org/releases/jessie/powerpc/release-notes/">
          an official, current 32-bit PowerPC release</a> (Jessie) at the time
        that I installed it. This is no longer the case (it's not what they
        dub a "release architecture" due to some problems), but it's still
        a part of the Debian "Ports" project, so a Sid-equivalent distro
        installer can be found <a href="https://cdimage.debian.org/cdimage/ports/current/">here</a>,
        along with several other less-popular architectures, and a Debian 10
        CD image was also apparently created for PowerPC (in an unofficial
        capacity) <a href="https://cdimage.debian.org/cdimage/ports/10.0/powerpc/iso-cd/">here</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Anyway, I burned a Debian installer CD-R, after unsuccessfully
        attempting to get it to boot off a USB. Apparently, it can be done, but I
        was quick to lose patience with Open Firmware and went for the install
        medium which I was more certain could actually work.

      </span>
      </div>
      <h3>Wireless</h3>
      <p>
        After the installation (successful, btw), I copied over the firmware
        files for the Broadcom wireless chipset (for the Linux b43 driver).
        The chip in my machine is a BCM4306, and the airport card is a
        non-standard pinout so I can't just put a better card (such as
        one with an atheros chip that uses the ath9k driver) in, unfortunately.
        This is something I could use the Cardbus slot for in the future, though.
      </p>
      <p>
        I've done this what feels like a dozen times or more on
        Intel machines, and it worked exactly the same here, so if you try this
        and have difficulties please note that you can just look at instructions
        from x86 users with older wireless chipsets. I happen to know
        that the process is quite similar on Dell Latitude D610 laptops, for
        instance, and I think the D630's as well. Many, many devices used
        Broadcom's BCM43xx chips for wireless LAN in the mid-to-late 2000's,
        so there's plenty of information out there.
      </p>
      <h3>Wireless: upgrade to 802.11n via the CardBus slot</h3>
      <p><b>Update:</b>Well, it's been about a month since I wrote the above,
        and I got a suitable card for dual-band 802.11n (draft) on the
        powerbook at a good price new old stock on eBay.</p>
      <p>Do note that I don't believe this card has any drivers for PPC OS X,
        so don't get one of these if that matters to you. I think one or two
        manufacturers <i>did</i> make CardBus cards for 802.11n on Powerbooks,
        but I don't think those used Atheros chipsets so I didn't bother
        investigating further.
      </p>
      <p>
        I specifically searched online for cards with Atheros chipsets because
        the "ath9k" Linux kernel driver can work with many of these chips
        without requiring a single binary firmware blob (so they are completely
        plug-n'-play under Linux, and I believe this is true under the BSD's as
        well). It had to not only be an Atheros card, it also had to be
        dual-band (not all 802.11n adapters are) and it had to be a CardBus
        card. I eventually settled on a card that reportedly contained an
        AR5416 chip – a D-Link DWA-645 rev. A2. I spent around $12 on it.
      </p>
      <div class="imgcontain">
      <span class="imgwrap">
      <a href="./powerbook_1/full/wlan.jpg"><img src="./powerbook_1/wlan.jpg" alt="The new wireless LAN card, installed."/></a>
      </span>
      <span class="imgwrap caption">
      <imgcentercaption>
        The new wireless LAN card, a D-Link DWA-645, plugged in. In my opinion,
        it doesn't look too bad!<br/>
        Also visible: this page, being edited in emacs.
      </imgcentercaption>
      </span>
      </div>
      <p>
        I plugged in the card, and lo and behold it "just worked" using the
        ath9k module. My wireless transfers to and from my other machines are
        now significantly faster than they were over 802.11g. My router
        is set up to broadcast on both 2.4GHz and ~5GHz bands in 802.11n, and
        I have a similar atheros upgrade done internally in my Thinkpad X201
        Tablet, which also yielded quite a nice reliability improvement over
        the original Intel 6200/6300 802.11n card it shipped with. While I'm
        not quite as big of a fan of newer 802.11ac ath10k cards from them
        (which require firmware blobs and are from after the Qualcomm buyout),
        I have nothing but praise for the ath9k cards and highly recommend them
        for any system.
      </p>
      <p>
        So far, the card jutting out of the side of the machine hasn't gotten
        in my way much; I'm quite happy with the results. Theoretically,
        since the drivers are totally open-source with no binary blobs, I think
        it'd be possible to backport the Linux kernel driver to OS X PPC, but
        I feel no particular motivation to do so.
      </p>
      <h3>Fixing X.org (X server hang at startup; Radeon bug)</h3>
      <p>
        Since I used a 'netinstall' cd without a network connection, my Debian
        install was extremely compact. It didn't even have an X server, so I
        installed one from a shell after getting a network connection.
        Unfortunately, I hit a problem when attempting to use it: it'd hang
        pretty quickly after starting up.
      </p>
      <p>
        It appears that Powerbooks with ATI GPU's have had issues ever since
        Kernel Mode-Setting (KMS) was introduced; additionally, recent kernels
        no longer contained the old User Mode-Setting (UMS) code. The issue
        stems from a bug with the AGP implementation on the Powerbook (I think
        maybe it was from a bridge chip, or something). Basically, a DMA
        controller (Direct Memory Access controller) would misbehave and
        corrupt something, if I remember correctly.
      </p>
      <p>
        There are three solutions for this problem:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>Downgrade my kernel and Mesa versions to ones that use UMS</li>
        <li>Force the GPU to run in "PCI Mode," basically foregoing the AGP
          expansions. AGP is based on the PCI bus, but from what I can tell
          can have additional bandwidth by more use of DMA. Running in PCI mode
          side-steps the issue.</li>
        <li>Fix the terrible AGP code in the kernel which no one uses or wants
          to touch (even x86 systems apparently have problems).</li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        Since I'm not a fan of running ancient kernels (I'd just use OS X
        10.4 if I were), and I don't think I'm that much of a wizard,
        I opted to force the GPU to run in PCI mode.
      </p>
      <p>
        This has to be done at boot-time. When the machine starts, there will
        be a Yaboot prompt, where it waits for a few seconds for you to type
        something and then boots up. Yaboot is basically the Open
        Firmware-based bootloader that Debian uses instead of GRUB by
        default on PowerPC. If you don't type anything (or just hit "return"),
        you'll see the word 'Linux' appear on the screen, followed by a couple
        more lines before the kernel starts showing its information.
      </p>
      <p>
        This prompt is a place that we can add new temporary parameters,
        though! When prompted, type (case-sensitive, I think):
      </p>
      <div class="codewrap">
        <pre class="block">Linux radeon.agpmode=-1</pre>
      </div>
      <p>
        …and press "return."
      </p>
      <p>
        X should now work mostly fine, but if I remember correctly, I still
        suffered from occasional hanging. I was able to fix this with some
        more options stuffed into '/etc/xorg.conf':
      </p>
      <div class="codewrap">
        <pre class="block">Section "Device"
    Identifier "Radeon"
    Driver "radeon"
    Option "AccelMethod" "EXA"
    Option "DRI" "2" # DRI3 tends to be unstable on everything I try it on, even modern-ish Intel machines.
    Option "EXAPixmaps" "on" # actually boosts performance when on, might cause instability on some machines but not mine.
    Option "TearFree" "on" # I just hate tearing, so I threw this in there.
    Option "EXAVsync" "on" # known to cause instability on some machines, see radeon man page. Mine seems fine.
EndSection</pre>
      </div>
      <p>
        I am not sure if you can ever reach the same
        speeds as you would if AGP actually worked, but honestly it runs well
        enough for me to use a composited window manager (compton) and to
        emulate a Sega Mega Drive/Genesis (using Genesis Plus GX), so that's
        all I really need.
      </p>
      <p>
        To make the change more permanent, there are multiple ways to proceed.
        One way that I see recommended is to add the argument to
        '/etc/yaboot.conf' (as an 'append=' line).
      </p>
      <p>
        This works, but if you start throwing a bunch of arguments onto the
        kernel, or if you have more than one kernel you want to choose between,
        this becomes a bit of a hassle. So I chose a different approach:
      </p>
      <p>
        I created a file called '/etc/modprobe.d/radeon.conf', containing
        these lines:
      </p>
      <div class="codewrap">
        <pre class="block">options radeon agpmode=-1
options radeonfb agpmode=-1</pre>
      </div>
      <p>
        I think the 'radeonfb' thing is a non-sequitur (frame-buffer with
        AGP DMA?) but better safe than sorry, since radeonfb is basically
        supposed to be a failsafe mode.
      </p>
      <p>
        I then ran these commands to make sure the changes stuck for my next
        boot (note that I think the 'ybin -v' was unnecessary, but it
        updates the yaboot configuration):
      </p>
      <div class="codewrap">
        <pre class="block">$ sudo update-initramfs -u
$ sudo ybin -v</pre>
      </div>
      <p>
        After doing that, my system has never hung in X.
      </p>
      <h3>Changing keyboard/mouse behaviors</h3>
      <p>
        I think the next thing I did (after installing an X server, since I
        had done a minimal offline install initially) was to make the touchpad
        less annoying (disable 'tap-to-click') and to make the "F*" keys send
        the "F*" keycodes instead of their "brightness/volume adjustment/etc."
        ones when pressed without holding the 'Fn' key. I found a package called
        '<a href="https://snapshot.debian.org/package/pmac-utils/1.1.3-27%2Bports/">pmac-utils</a>'
        which contained the tools I was looking for. After it was installed, I
        added the following to the end of my '/etc/rc.local' file:
      </p>
      <div class="codewrap">
        <pre class="block">if [ -e /sbin/trackpad ]; then
  /sbin/trackpad notap || /bin/true
fi
if [ -e /sbin/fnset ]; then
  /sbin/fnset -u || /bin/true
fi</pre>
      </div>
      <p>
        Note that if you are using systemd as your init system, you can't run
        stuff at boot from 'rc.local' like I did. I'm using 'sysvinit' (System V
        Init) for my init system. You'll have to find your own way to run stuff
        at boot. A quick search suggests that
        <a href="https://www.cyberciti.biz/faq/how-to-enable-rc-local-shell-script-on-systemd-while-booting-linux-system/">
          this might not be too hard to do</a>, but I have not tried it myself.
      </p>
      <h3>Right-click with touchpad using Mouseemu</h3>
      <p>
        I also installed a program called
        '<a href="https://snapshot.debian.org/package/mouseemu/0.15-10/">mouseemu</a>,'
        which basically can intercept keystrokes and mouse/touchpad inputs,
        listening for keyboard modifiers when clicking to simulate pressing other
        mouse buttons. I decided to configure it so that holding a 'command' key
        while clicking would send a right click keystroke.
      </p>
      <p>
        This program has a side-effect of preventing buttons beyond the standard
        left click, right click, and middle click/scroll from working when using
        an external USB mouse (since it intercepts and translates input from
        all devices), so I also made
        <a href="https://github.com/wyatt8740/mouseemu">a modified version of it</a>
        that can pass through two additional mouse buttons (BTN_SIDE and BTN_EXTRA).
        These are the other buttons on a Microsoft Trackball Optical and are used
        in many mouses for navigating forward and backward in a web browser
        (they are mouse button ID's 8 and 9 in X).
        <a href="https://github.com/wyatt8740/mouseemu/commit/97433b536fea43ba22e5feaee803c931b196fe01">My patch is here</a>,
        by the way, in case you want to add even more buttons yourself.
      </p>
      <p>
        Mouseemu is configured on my system via /etc/default/mouseemu, which is
        sourced by init scripts in /etc/init.d/. I am pretty sure that the
        configuration is sourced the same way on a Systemd-as-init machine. To
        find the keycodes you need to pass to it, either find the key ID's in
        'include/linux/input.h' or run 'showkey' outside of X (in a TTY;
        ctrl-alt-f1 for instance). Here's my personal configuration
        (note: pretty sure 272 is the mouse button event):
      </p>
      <div class="codewrap">
        <pre class="block">RIGHT_CLICK="-right 125 272"   # command + click
MID_CLICK="-middle 100 272"    # fn+alt+click
SCROLL="-scroll 0"             # disable scroll key for now pending investigation (no idea how it works...)
TYPING_BLOCK="-typing-block 0" # block mouse for 0ms after a keypress, or it interferes with playing Quake!</pre>
      </div>
      <p>
        If you don't like the sensitivity or other things with the
        touchpad, and you are using mouseemu, note that any configuration changes
        need to target the "Mouseemu virtual mouse" device, rather than the
        "ADB mouse," for instance. This is because Mouseemu basically acts as
        a middle-man between your keyboard/mouse and X.
      </p>
      <h3 id="powerbook-mplayer">Video Playback: MPlayer</h3>
      <p>
        The PowerBook G4 seems to be pretty underpowered by today's standards
        in many ways; one of the most immediately recognizeable is how much it
        struggles to decode h.264 and render videos. It can handle 480p well
        enough, but chokes if you try 720p (for the screen's native
        resolution). At first, I thought this was the GPU's fault (on account
        of having to disable the DMA functionality/AGP features), but later I
        remembered "oh, yeah. back in the day h.264 required good hardware to
        decode." I'd compare it to trying to decode HEVC on my circa 2010
        laptop hardware.
      </p>
      <p>
        Additionally, mpv's codebase is regularly purged of anything "legacy,"
        and the performance of the supported video output drivers is not
        great. I've always been partial to
        <a href="https://mplayerhq.hu/design7/news.html">MPlayer</a>, anyway,
        so I grabbed and compiled it. I discovered the best video output driver
        for performance to be 'Vidix.' Documentation on Vidix is quite lacking,
        and the code for it appears to be about twenty years old, so it was a
        little confusing to figure out. Basically, though, it requires direct
        hardware access, so mplayer needs to be run as root (either with sudo
        or a setuid bit). Additionally, to tell it I am using a radeon card,
        I put this in my ~/.mplayer/config file:
      </p>
      <div class="codewrap">
        <pre class="block">vo=xvidix:radeon</pre>
      </div>
      <p>
        I think I had to put that under /root/.mplayer/config, actually, on
        account of having to run as root.
      </p>
      <p>
        Anyway, after doing that, I still had the h.264 problem. So with my
        sample video (
        <a href="./007_008.html#bubblegum-review-1"><i>Bubblegum Crisis</i>,
          episode 5: "Moonlight Rambler"</a>), I converted it to use
        almost-MPEG-4 video (xvid codec) via ffmpeg on my desktop and then
        moved the file over. The resulting video (using xvid for video and
        vorbis for audio) played back at full speed with no tearing at 720p
        in MPlayer!
      </p>
      <p>
        It is possible baseline profile h.264 could have also worked, but I
        didn't test that. Xvid videos are so fast to encode; it's great. I
        hadn't used it in a long time. It's also possible that proper MPEG-4
        (-vcodec mpeg4 in ffmpeg) might have worked. Xvid is technically a
        derivative of the draft MPEG-4 implementation as created by Microsoft
        in the late 90's or early 2000's, so it's approximately period correct
        as well.
      </p>
      <h3 id="powerbook-fvwm">FVWM (Window Manager)</h3>
      <p>
        FVWM is a very light-weight window manager that I like to use on my
        computers.
      </p>
      <p>
        I discovered FVWM when I was trying to run Debian on an Android phone
        with an X server based on SDL. It worked when a lot of other WM's
        didn't want to, and I also managed to configure it to behave closer to
        what I expect of a "regular" window manager like Gnome/MATE or the MS
        Windows window manager. Reading the documentation, it quickly became
        clear to me that FVWM was <i>ridiculously</i> flexible.
      </p>
      <p>
        Since I was able to make it do basically everything I wanted, I
        remembered it when I later decided to try CDE (Common Desktop
        Environment) on a whim over a weekend. It seemed kind of nice, but
        also pretty limiting. I decided that I could use FVWM to make it act
        like MWM (Motif Window Manager, the basis for CDE) with a few more
        features. And then I just sort of never looked back.
      </p>
      <p>
        My FVWM config file is based on modifications to the FVWM 2.6 template
        file that shipped with Debian, but I now run FVWM 3.x (built from git).
        FVWM3 supports multiple monitors and rotation slightly better via
        RANDR - 2.6 only supports Xinerama, which is pretty much no longer in
        use. Other than that, up to this point, the configuration file has
        required only minimal alterations to work in FVWM 3.x.
      </p>
      <p>
        One of the nicest things about FVWM is the console. You can
        interactively configure things in FVWM by writing lines in a console
        to test them without reloading your <code>fvwmrc</code>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Anyway, not too much to say here, except that FVWM performs nicely,
        and with a compositor (e.g., Compton, Picom), it also renders well.
        If there's any behavior of it that you don't like, it is very likely
        possible to change it (without having to recompile anything) via its
        configuration file. To move to a new computer, it's as easy as copying
        the <code>~/.fvwmrc</code> file or <code>~/.fvwm</code> directory.
      </p>
      <p>
        To extoll more virtues of FVWM, it's easy to implement things like a
        "forced full-screen" mode by making a keyboard shortcut that hides
        the decorations and borders on the current window and then maximizes
        it. FVWM can also be used to make pretty much any other keyboard
        shortcuts one might want, whether they be for window manager actions
        or for launching external programs/scripts.
      </p>
      <p>
        Anyway, I recommend FVWM not only for lightweight systems like this
        but for all Unix machines. It's really excellent. If you're an emacs
        user already, you will be quick to understand its appeal to me when
        you try it.
      </p>
      <p>
        ...What do you mean, you "don't use emacs?"
      </p>
      <h3>To-Do (Article Under Construction):</h3>
      <p>
        I'll try to come back to this and expand on it later. There's
        tons more stuff that I've also done. Here's an outline of topics
        that I think I can cover (consider it an informative teaser, of sorts):
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Curbing overly-aggressive (and loud) fans</li>
        <ul>
          <li>The 7447a is rated for 105°C max. die junction temperature</li>
          <li>The onboard sensor is wildly inaccurate, but still within ±20°C,
            I think</li>
          <li>Kernel makes the fans kick on at 50°C, by default, which is
            basically the temperature it reaches when starting a web browser
            or otherwise not being idle</li>
          <li>Powerbook fans are LOUD</li>
          <li>My solution: bump threshold for activation up by 5-8°C or so,
            resulting in a far quieter system while still well within the safe
            temperature range
          </li>
        </ul>
        <li>Fixing Firefox 52/Seamonkey 2.49 on PowerPC:</li>
        <ul>
          <li>Official Debian package was really buggy/crash-prone</li>
          <li>Performance went way up by comparison; crashes pretty much never</li>
          <li>Re-introduces ALSA support (no pulseaudio requirement for sound anymore)</li>
          <li>various post-installation tweaks to its configuration to improve
            compatibility with modern websites</li>
          <li>Newer versions of FF appear to be a showstopper, due to vast
            architectural changes and general apathy on Mozilla's part, but I
            will discuss possible solutions/workarounds.</li>

        </ul>
        <li>Getting GIMP 2.10</li>
        <ul>
          <li>Basically, a library Gimp 2.10 uses (gegl, I think) builds fine,
            but one of the post-build tests times out due to poor performance on
            PowerPC (and MIPS).</li>
          <li>I blame Meson, because I generally find myself
            annoyed with it for other reasons, too, and it's a good scapegoat</li>
          <li>Due to this, Debian's build bots think the package failed to build</li>
          <li>Since it depends on this library, GIMP 2.10 doesn't exist in the
            Debian repositories for PowerPC</li>
          <li>However, you can tweak the build configuration, rebuild it yourself,
            and then (after a very slow/long build process) GIMP 2.10 actually
            works fine. I'll detail how to do this</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Porting software-rendered and GL Quake (Quake 1)</li>
        <ul>
          <li>I prefer software-rendered quake over any of the "modern" engines;
            after a lot of confusion I figured out how to get this version working
            on PowerPC (avoiding x86-specific assembly code)</li>

            Unfortunately it's hard to find a link to (though it IS
            semi-publicly available, still) and is rather out of date. J9 for

              is the URL, but you'll need to register for an
              IBM account to access it. Also note that that link was valid
              at the time that I downloaded it, which was in June 2018. I
              just had it bookmarked on one of my machines. I forget my IBM ID,
              so I can't verify it now (in 2021) too easily.

          </ul>
          <li>
            Since IBM recently released J9 as open-source, some efforts have
            been made to add 32-bit PowerPC support back (it got dropped at
            some point prior to the open-source release); it appears this can
            mostly work, but I have no idea how to cross-compile it, and am not
            sure I have the motivation, either.

      <h2>Coercing RGB from Retro Video Game Consoles on the Cheap<br/>
        Or:<br/>
        Modifying Game Consoles for Fun and Less Financial Damage
      </h2>
      <p><i>15 May 2020</i> [<a class="permalink" href="./003_004.html#psx-rgb-1">Permanent link</a>]<br/>
        One of my long-standing hobbies (and at times mild obsessions) is
        getting everything I can out of old video game hardware. Back when I
        started getting interested in old video games, lots of these systems
        like the NES, Super NES, and so on were relatively affordable and
        cheap.
      </p>
      <p>
        Unfortunately, however, in the last ten years or so I've been noticing
        prices rise. a NES game I got for $10 to $15 might be $25 or $30 now;
        the best example I know of in my collection is Chrono Trigger, which
        seems to like selling for $100 nowadays. The best example I
        <i>don't</i> own that I would like to is Earthbound for SNES. I've
        basically given up on finding that one; it's just proof (in my mind)
        that people are sometimes crazy with the value they attribute to
        things.        
      </p>
      <p>
        In the same way, accessories for consoles are staying pretty costly,
        for the most part. And a "cottage industry" has developed around
        providing new accessories for these old systems. For me, the most
        interesting (and aggravating) of these is the manufacture of RGB video
        cables.
      </p>
      <h3>Crazy Cables</h3>
      <p>
        There are few consoles that use a "standardized" connector for any
        form of video signal of higher quality than RF. Notably, the original
        western NES revisions can output composite video and monaural audio
        using RCA jacks, which it seems manufacturers since stepped back from.
        My only guess is that they discovered they could make more profit by
        selling special cables with proprietary connectors separately from the
        consoles themselves. Maybe this has gotten better with the advent of
        HDMI, but as my newest game console is (still) a Nintendo Wii, I have
        not bothered to check this. It seems to be the case, if vague memories
        of discussions with others are anything to go by.
      </p>
      <p>
        Anyway, back to the RGB video cable issue. In the 90's, essentially
        nobody in North America had RGB-capable sets, and even those with
        15.6KHz (TV-frequency) RGB monitors for computers (like the Amiga)
        most likely didn't have cables for RGB from their consoles or even
        know that the consoles exposed RGB video signals on their A/V
        connectors. For most people, S-Video was good enough on the consoles
        that would support it. For consoles like the Sega Genesis, which didn't
        offer S-Video, though… Well, they just had to make do, I guess.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now, after a decade of (initially affordable) RGB CRT monitors from
        professional installations being readily available, the situation has
        changed. Additionally, scalers and other devices for connecting
        consoles to modern sets have appeared. The best quality video signal
        that can be had from most consoles is RGB, so there is now some demand
        for RGB video cables in North America. The cottage industry that's
        sprung up seems to be a little on the crazy side, though. All the
        prices below are the cheapest-priced options that could possibly work on
        my monitor; they are not the "optimal" or "most compatible" options
        that this particular business sells (it claims to be the number one
        option for such cables– a claim which seems very substantiated by
        the number of people I've talked to who have used them, at least).

      <p>
        …Uh, that's <b>$152.45</b>.
        <i>Before shipping from the UK to the US.</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        I never paid that much for <b>any</b> of my old consoles. In fact, that
        might be around as much as I paid for all of them <b>combined</b>.
      </p>
      <p>
        In 2005, I could have purchased a brand new Nintendo DS with that money.
      </p>
      <p>
        I could buy a more-than-decent brand new graphics card <i>today</i> for that much.
      </p>
      <p>
        Or maybe even purchase a textbook for a university course.
      </p>
      <p>
        And who even knows how long it'd take the package to get overseas and
        past customs! Also, if the cable ever breaks, I have to do it all
        over again. It's pretty frustrating to stop in the middle of an RPG
        (I mostly like JRPG's; I bought a Master System almost entirely for
        Phantasy Star and Ys).
      </p>
      <p>
        This is worsened by the fact that all sellers seem to be fixated on the
        idea that I'm going to use SCART for connecting my systems, which is
        silly as SCART switches are expensive, practically nothing in america
        even <i>uses</i> SCART connectors (so they're hard to source), and
        even in Europe they're rather obsolete in 2020. So to use their cables,
        I additionally have to purchase a "SCART to BNC" cable to connect to
        the back of my monitor.
      </p>
      <p>
        I guess most people into this stuff are probably older than me, have
        good paying jobs, and are further ahead in life than me as an
        undergraduate studying at a university. Still, those prices are a
        pretty huge barrier to entry for a near-minimum-wage worker in a state
        where the minimum wage is still $7.25.
        Even after I was lucky enough to get a nice RGB CRT or two by mostly
        luck and chance (with maybe a pinch of initiative-taking. Possibly a
        teensy bit of soliciting as well).
      </p>
      <h3>A More Economical Way</h3>
      <p> I have seven consoles that I play somewhat often.  Of those, five
        output RGB as their highest-quality option, one outputs component video
        (the Wii), and one outputs composite video (my Famicom, which is modded
        and can output composite like an american NES can).
        I have four in the images above, since I already have something that I
        got at the same time as my Amiga 500 which obviates my problems there
        (a 23-pin-Amiga-RGB to VGA adapter; used with my Commodore 1942
        monitor).
      </p>
      <p>
        The Famicom and the Wii are the easiest to get top quality out of; I
        modded the Famicom for composite video myself and was able to re-use
        the existing holes in the back of the shell for composite video via
        RCA and dual mono audio via a TRS jack. The Wii was super easy, because
        I was able to get a new (third-party but decent quality) component
        (YPbPr) multi-system cable meant for it, the XBox 360, and the PS3 on
        clearance at a GameStop in around 2014 or 2015.
      </p>
      <p>
        Most of my other consoles I drilled holes in to add RCA jacks to carry
        Red, Green, and Blue signals, as well as a composite sync signal. In a
        couple cases, I added S-Video jacks as well.
      </p>
      <h3>Sega Sync Peculiarities</h3>
      <p>
        Do note that for sync
        on Mega Drive/Genesis systems (and Master Systems, I believe), a little
        work is needed if you want to use the CSync connection on the back.
        Without this work, the load on the CSync line will make the video
        outputs from the VDP chip black due to the CSync line being connected
        straight to the VDP (on an open-collector transistor output) instead of
        coming out of the encoder chip. Any direct load on the VDP like this
        will basically mean it is unable to produce a picture.

      </span>
      </div>
      <p>
        Note that CSync obtained like this will be +5V; most screens are fine
        with this, but a handful of picky ones will need a resistor to bring
        it down to 1 volt. Remember: this resistor will form a voltage
        divider with the monitor's 75-ohm resistive load when connected; you
        can think of it as being a 75 ohm resistor on the monitor's sync plug
        that connects between the signal pin and ground. To get a one volt
        output with 75 ohms already running between the output and ground, the
        resistor in series on the sync line should be 300 ohms, if I did the
        math correctly.
      </p>
      <p>
        Sets requiring this resistor might also want a 220µF capacitor
        somewhere on the line to remove the DC bias (coupling) and turn it
        into a roughly one volt peak-to-peak (±0.5V) signal.  The capacitor
        is likely not strictly necessary, but does make the signal more
        "standard compliant," nominally, and probably won't be a bad thing.
        None of my displays need either the resistor nor the capacitor, but
        I've heard that some scalers might. I did put the capacitor on,
        regardless. Since these caps are typically polarized, put it with
        the 'negative' (–) leg facing towards the monitor.

      <h3>Sony PlayStation: a Super Cheap, Easy Shortcut for RGB</h3>
      <p>
        Okay, now that all that build-up and context has been brought into the
        light, I can get to the point I originally had in mind when I sat down
        to write this post. These things always end up way longer than I
        expect them to. Sorry. I start writing and just don't stop sometimes
        (At least that carries over into documenting my code as well; I wish
        it made me like writing essays for classes more, though).
      </p>
      <p>
        On the original PlayStation, RGB out via adding RCA jacks seems harder
        to do at first glance, since there's a thick metal RF shielding plate
        which doubles as a support structure for the CD pickup mechanism. This
        means I can't just remove it. It also comes up really close to the
        plastic on the back of the console, which means I don't have space for
        adding any more jacks. Additionally, for all the times that I've done
        it, I don't actually like cutting holes in my systems if I can easily
        avoid it. With the PSX, I have managed to avoid cutting a single hole
        while staying economical and only using pre-made cables. If anything,
        it's actually a better solution than I have for most of my other
        systems, since it doesn't require any console modding and can actually
        be done using only American-market official Sony products, if desired.
        One of the two products is additionally extremely common secondhand and
        might still be available new. The second product is a little older and
        less common, but still available for pretty reasonable prices and
        sometimes even findable locally.
      </p>
      <p>
        Depending on your revision of PSX, there are two easy routes you can
        take that both avoid having to make modifications (although I did make
        one small adjustment, just to improve the results ever so slightly).
      </p>
      <h3>PSX Revision Identification</h3>
      <p>
        There are actually a bunch of micro-revisions of the original
        Playstation, but for this particular post's purposes we can
        use a radically simplified shorthand version of it. We can do this
        since only one of those differences really matters here, and it's a
        rather blatantly obvious difference when examining a Playstation unit.
        Probably the first one most average people would notice.
        You tell me if you can spot it.
      </p>
      <span class="imgwrap">
      <a href="./rgb_stuff/full/psx_diff_01.jpg"><img src="./rgb_stuff/psx_diff_01.jpg" alt="Picture of two different-revision PlayStation units."/></a>
      </span>
      <p>
        If your answer was, “The top one has seen better days,” well, you'd
        be right. If I can ever work up the courage to show pictures of the
        repair work I've done inside, you'll see that you're more right than
        you could possibly have known. As it is, though, I'm slightly ashamed
        of how it looks inside, even though I did what had to be done
        for it to work properly again. It definitely required an inordinate
        amount of time and effort to get it to 100% when compared to all of my
        other consoles.
      </p>
      <p>
        In any case, that's not actually the important distinction, just
        another “story for another time.” Unless you are using a browser that
        doesn't show pictures (like Lynx), you can probably also see the lack
        of RCA jacks on the bottom one. That's the actual important difference
        here for the purposes of this post.
      </p>
      <p>
        The sharpie'd word "LUMA" written on the console with the jacks is
        tangentially relevant, but since this post is already so long I'll
        save it for another time. It's only marginally important as an
        improvement to the basic idea I'm trying to communicate in an overly
        verbose manner, but I basically just re-routed the S-Video luma line
        to the yellow RCA jack for a slightly more stable sync signal than
        the composite signal with color information would be able to provide.
      </p>
      <p>
        You see, very early original PlayStation units came with RCA jacks
        (and in Japan, even a standard S-Video connector at first). Later
        units removed those. Unfortunately, this removal roughly coincided with
        Sony's transition from a truly terrible CD drive design to a simply
        mediocre one.
      </p>
      <p>
        The mediocre one was <i>definitely</i> much better than the original,
        since it had the upshot of not grinding itself out of alignment over
        the span of a few years. This unfortunate tendency seems to have made
        original units with jacks rather less common, though I suppose that
        could also just be because they were most expensive at launch and had
        less games available at first. So maybe they just didn't sell too many
        by comparison to the wave that was to come.
      </p>
      <p>
        Or maybe I've just had strange luck with what units show up in stores,
        so my idea of the statistics are skewed.
      </p>
      <p>
        Anyway, the unfortunate thing is that if your system has RCA jacks, and
        it's not been serviced at some point, it probably has one of the really
        unreliable drives inside and probably already struggles reading discs.
        Unlike the later units, where simply oiling the spindle motor is
        usually all they need to work perfectly, the early units basically just
        need to be replaced if you want them to be dependable. I did so with
        mine, but it requires having a drive to swap in, and usually pulling
        from another newer, working console.
      </p>
      <p>
        You can also try rolling the dice on one of the newly manufactured
        clone drives that you can get from places like ebay and AliExpress;
        I've had some of those that worked perfectly and silently, and some
        that would cut nice rings into my CD's with their lenses. If you buy
        them, I suggest buying and burning cheap CD-R's with music (or games,
        if you have a modchip) to test the drives out before trusting them
        with your authentic discs.
      </p>
      <p>
        So either your system has the RCA jacks built in and is unreliable
        for a lack of spare parts, or you have to buy one more thing to derive
        RGB from newer ones (still more affordably than those cables above).
        I'll explain both of these solutions now.
      </p>
      <h3>On Systems With RCA Jacks</h3>
      <p>
        If you have the revision with the RCA jacks, and your CD drive is
        miraculously working (be it due to repairs, incredible luck, or some
        other form of high wizardry), then all you need to get RGB out of your
        playstation is a PS3 component video cable and an additional straight
        single RCA ↔ RCA cable.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you want to get rid of the DC coupling on the video signals, however,
        you will need to do more work internally that I'm not covering in this
        post because I've been typing this for over two hours now. I've done
        it, but it is not strictly necessary and not doing so is nowhere near
        as bad as not removing the DC coupling from audio signals (speakers are
        sensitive to it, but TV's really aren't).
      </p>
      <p>With that caveat in mind, all you have to do for basic RGB output is
        to run a wire from the yellow RCA jack to your sync input. Most
        screens will accept this as sync. Then the component cable's Y line
        goes to Green, Pb goes to Blue, and Pr goes to Red. Use three
        RCA-to-BNC adapters on the back of your screen, if yours uses
        them.
      </p>
      <h3>On Systems Without RCA Jacks</h3>
      <p>
        You'll need to find a “guncon” (light gun) adapter; I recommend the
        Sony SCPH-1160, since it's an official product and it has a fully
        populated AV connector that passes through everything to another
        “A/V Multi Out” connector on the far end. I haven't used others,
        so I'm not sure if they will carry all signals like this does.
      </p>
      <p>
        It's also, coincidentally, the only official Sony product I've seen
        in person with a fully-populated A/V connector! Unfortunately, it
        seems strangely uncommon on ebay at the moment. I found mine in a
        local used game store for $5 or so, though, so I guess you might just
        have to stay vigilant. They don't seem to go over $10 or $15, even on
        ebay where everything with old video games seems overvalued now.
      </p>
      <p>
        …Boy, am I going to love getting older. I can already see the
        bitterness starting. I'll have to keep that in check.
      </p>
      <span class="imgwrap">
        <a href="./rgb_stuff/full/scph_1160.jpg"><img src="./rgb_stuff/scph_1160.jpg" alt="Picture of SCPH-1160 guncon adapter/RCA breakout."/></a>

      </span>
      <p>
        My particular SCPH-1160 has had the same mod done as the 1001 has internally,
        where I replaced the yellow RCA jack's composite output with the
        S-Video luma output. I additionally connected the composite signal to
        the multi-out so that it can be passed through if desired. I might
        post pictures of that later, but I've been working on this post for a
        long time, so I'm not really feeling like taking it apart again right
        now. You don't actually have to perform any mods inside it for this to
        work; there's just a very slight possible improvement to sync stability
        that can result from it.
      </p>
      <p>
        You can also (if you so desire) add decoupling capacitors for the RGB
        lines inside of an SCPH-1160, but again, it is not likely to matter
        for anything but audio signals which already have been decoupled inside
        the PSX.

        So basically, you just use this 1160 dongle or similar as a breakout to
        give you the same RCA jacks you'd get from an early revision system.
        From there, you've got your sync signal, and so you can deliver the
        remaining R/G/B (and audio) signals through a PS3 component cable.
        PS3 component cables use the same pins for Y/Pb/PR as earlier systems
        would use for G/B/R, respectively, so this works out rather well.

            This is the output from the SCPH-1001 (the one with RCA jacks built in).<br/>
            Definitely one of the most wonderful looking PSX RPG's I've seen.
            The obligatory isometric 3D outside of battles is kind of annoying, though.
