        Thoughts on the Unicomp Mini M Keyboard<br/>

      <imgcentercaption>
        The Unicomp Mini M is, to my knowledge, the first entirely new keyboard
        design Unicomp has produced since it started in around 1996 (the year
        that I was born). This is my own unit, which has already been subject
        to a couple small alterations (note the bottom key row).

      <p>
        <a href="https://www.pckeyboard.com/">Unicomp</a>, based in Lexington,
        Kentucky, is a company with an unusual history. Its continued
        ability to exist is honestly something of a miracle to me, although
        I'm still quite happy that it seems to manage. They are the sole
        company that has been a source for IBM membrane-buckling-spring
        keyboards (and parts for them) for the past twenty-five years or so.
      </p>
      <p>
        They appear to have started when Lexmark spun off its keyboard
        manufacturing arm (Lexmark itself having been spun off of IBM
        a few years earlier). For most of their existance, they have mainly
        acted as a company that manufactures keyboards for a variety of
        IBM terminals and other IBM/Lexmark equipment.
      </p>
      <p>
        Over the last quarter century, however, many have observed that the
        company hasn't responded much to demand changes or indeed shown many
        attempts at expanding their business. Indeed, over the years, they
        have discontinued production of a fair number of their products
        (for instance, their
        <a href="https://deskthority.net/wiki/Unicomp_Keyboards#Mighty_Mouse">
          Mighty Mouse</a> keyboard with trackpoint, which was modelled after
        a thinkpad keyboard).
