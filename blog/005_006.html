        Thoughts on the Unicomp Mini M Keyboard<br/>
      </h2>
      <p><i>14 June 2021</i> [<a class="permalink" href="./005_006.html#unicomp-mini-1">Permanent link</a>]<br/>
      </p>
      <a href="./unicomp_1/full/UT40E7A_0001034_01.jpg"><img src="./unicomp_1/UT40E7A_0001034_01.jpg" alt="The Unicomp Mini M, a new keyboard. This is my own unit."/></a>
      <imgcentercaption>
        The Unicomp Mini M is, to my knowledge, the first entirely new keyboard
        design Unicomp has produced since it started in around 1996 (the year
        that I was born). This is my own unit, which has already been subject
        to a couple small alterations (note the bottom key row).
      </imgcentercaption>
      <h3>First, Some History</h3>
      <p>
        <a href="https://www.pckeyboard.com/">Unicomp</a>, based in Lexington,
        Kentucky, is a company with an unusual history. Its continued
        ability to exist is honestly something of a miracle to me, although
        I'm still quite happy that it seems to manage. They are the sole
        company that has been a source for IBM membrane-buckling-spring
        keyboards (and parts for them) for the past twenty-five years or so.
      </p>
      <h3>Buckling Springs and Why I Like Them</h3>
      <p>
        The reasons why the buckling spring mechanism is favored by some has
        been discussed to death already, but I'll try to do a short run-down on
        it here. Essentially, the buckling spring mechanism provides a
        <i>hugely</i> tactile and aggressively "clicky" typing experience.
        I have used many designs of keyboards with many variations of switches,
        but I always end up landing back on these buckling spring boards for
        the pure typing pleasure of them.
      </p>
      <p>
        The switches work such that a spring is mounted on a pivoting "leg"
        atop a sensing mechanism (in this case a plastic membrane sheet, but
        in the past IBM also made a variant that used capacitive legs and
        sensors, termed the "Model F.") When pressure is placed on the top
        of the spring by the insertion of a key on top of it, it is applied in
        an 'unbalanced' manner, such that even at rest the spring is bent
        forward slightly. To illustrate this point, I'll refer to IBM's
        US patents <a href="https://patents.google.com/patent/US4118611A/en">
          US4118611A</a> (Model F) and
        <a href="https://patents.google.com/patent/US4528431A/en">
          US4528431A</a> (Model M), which provide some good drawings of
        the basic idea. Even more useful, however (in my opinion) are
        recordings of the mechanism in action, which provide a good substitute
        if you've not got a keyboard of your own in your hands to test with.
      </p>

      <imgcentercaption>
        Recording of a cutaway of a buckling spring as it is pressed, buckles,
        and pings against the barrel surrounding the spring.
        <br/>
        This animation comes from "<a href="http://ex4.sakura.ne.jp/kb/tech_bucklingspring_e.htm">
          Qwerters Clinic</a>," a Japanese website dedicated to many kinds of
        keyboard designs and switches.
        <br/>
        I highly recommend reading the linked page for more detailed
        explanation of how it works. The page is in English.
      </imgcentercaption>
      <p>
      The buckling spring in the above illustration is actually of what's
      termed a "Brother buckling spring," which was made by Brother in Japan
      under license from IBM. While the exact switch is slightly different,
      the idea remains the same. Most notably, the switches are totally
      modular on Brother keyboards and can be individually removed and
      disassembled, unlike the only model M boards we got stateside which
      moulded all of the barrels into a single plastic plate which must be
      removed to completely access the mechanism.
      </p>
      <p>
        Unlike many other key switches, even clicky ones, buckling springs
        create a feeling of a "snapping" on each key press, and the force
        required to press down the switch actually builds upon pressing,
        dropping off dramatically after actuation. In most clicky switches,
        the force required is relatively constant by comparison. The springs
        are quite noisy, but if you can get away with it, it's totally
        worth it, in my opinion.
      </p>
      <h3>Unicomp's Track Record</h3>
      <p>
        Over the last quarter century, many have observed that Unicomp hasn't
        responded much to demand changes, or indeed shown many attempts at
        expanding their business. Indeed, over the years, they have
        discontinued production of a fair number of their other products
        inherited from IBM, such as their
        <a href="https://deskthority.net/wiki/Unicomp_Keyboards#Mighty_Mouse">
          Mighty Mouse</a> keyboard with trackpoint, which was modelled after
        a thinkpad keyboard. Note that this was not a buckling spring board,
        but it was still a pretty nice small keyboard with a pointing stick,
        handy for navigation and for things like server racks.
      </p>
      <p>For almost as long as they haven't made them, people have been
        requesting that Unicomp manufacture a numpad-less Model M, akin to
        IBM's "space-saving keyboard" (SSK) of old. Apparently, when Lexmark
        sold to Unicomp, they did not have the equipment for manufacturing this
        variant any longer, and the company was in no position to be able to
        afford to make new tooling (which is expensive).
      </p>
      <p>
        Instead, they subsisted by manufacturing those boards which they
        <i>did</i> have the tooling for, i.e., their 101-key boards.
        Apparently, they also had the tooling to make boards with Windows keys.
        In any case, this served them well enough, but over the years I saw
        a significant number of people grumbling that they'd buy a Unicomp
        board "<i>if only they made an SSK.</i>"
      </p>
      <p>
        Fast-forwarding a decade or two, after many delays, Unicomp has pulled
        through. Their new
        "<a href="https://www.pckeyboard.com/page/product/MINI_M">Mini M</a>,"
        as they call it, finally
        <a href="https://www.pckeyboard.com/mm5/graphics/February_2021_New_Product_Announcements.pdf">
          officially launched</a> in February of this year (2021). Although it
        is unfortunately available in black only for the moment, it's a
        definite step in the right direction, and I bought one recently.
      </p>
      <p>
        After using it for a couple weeks, I think I'm ready to start talking
        about what my impressions on it are. My experience is mostly positive,
        although I'll dive more into it in the following paragraphs. If you
        just want a "yes" or "no," though, then <i>yes</i>, I am happy that I
        bought it.
      </p>
      <h3>Diving Deeper into the Mini M</h3>
      <h4>Initial Order and Delivery</h4>
      <p>
        I ordered the board around June sixth or seventh, and since I
        was a pre-orderer, I think that they gave my order priority.
        They claimed that on account of high demand, orderers should anticipate
        a four to six week lead time normally, but my board arrived on the
        ninth. It was only travelling from Kentucky to Indiana, but I was still
        impressed!
      </p>
      <p>
        The sticker on the bottom of the board says that it was built on the
        seventh. I'm not sure if they build these things "to-order," or if
        they really are just struggling to keep up with the orders.
      </p>
      <a href="./unicomp_1/full/UT40E7A_0001034_03.jpg"><img src="./unicomp_1/UT40E7A_0001034_03.jpg"/></a>
      <p>
        At any rate, I'm happy that I pre-ordered sometime last year. I am
        equally happy that I waited until June to get the board, since there
        are reports that boards produced before sometime in April or May have
        a firmware issue where the 'Q' key (and possibly others) can stop
        registering after several hours plugged in. While Unicomp is offering
        to fix the boards of people who experience the issue, it's just
        something I don't have to deal with.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you want to check your keyboard's firmware version, it's relatively
        simple to do it. On a Linux machine, you can do something like this:
      </p>
      <pre class="block">$ lsusb |grep Unicomp
Bus 003 Device 002: ID 17f6:1862 Unicomp, Inc. U AP1_4_87k_Kbrd_v7_56</pre>
      <p>
        The key information you're looking for is technically in what 'lsusb'
        calls the 'iProduct' field. On non-Linux systems, or on Linux systems
        without the 'lsusb' tool, you may have to find other means to get
        that information.
      </p>
      <p>
        Just for my own amusement, I tried to find the same information on my
        only bare-metal Windows installation on a USB-compatible machine:
        a Dell Latitude D610 running XP SP3.
      </p>
      <a href="./unicomp_1/full/winxp_devmgmt.png"><img src="./unicomp_1/winxp_devmgmt.jpg"/></a>
      <imgcentercaption>Hopefully, this will still be relevant to those of you
      that are using Windows 11.</imgcentercaption>
      <p>
        The key here is the 'v7_56' part. From what I can gather, it seems
        that the boards with the 'Q' key issue are on v7_52 or some older
        version.
      </p>
      <p>
        At the same time, though, I sort of wish that I'd been just a little
        bit earlier so I could have gotten a sub-1000 serial number and
        still dodged the issue. ;)
      </p>
      <p>
        When I first pulled it out of the box, a couple keycaps were popped
        off, but they keyboard was wrapped in plastic and the box included
        instructions for replacing keys that come loose in shipping. Honestly,
        I re-seated the two or three keys by just pushing down on them, prior
        to even reading or looking at the papers (a friend of mine came over
        just as I was picking up the box, and he snatched the papers to read
        while I was looking at the board, so I didn't notice them for a good
        ten minutes).
      </p>
      <p>
        The box was a simple, no-frills brown cardboard one, nearly identical
        to the one that Unicomp shipped me a full-size "classic" M case in
        a few years back, but shorter to accomodate the lack of a numeric pad
        on the product inside it. It had cardboard inserts to hold the
        keyboard steady during shipment, and it did a fine job.
      </p>
      <p>
        Also in the box was a Monoprice six-foot USB A-to-A cable. It's funny
        to see a Monoprice branded cable in there, but it makes me think that
        either their prices are just that good, or maybe other industrial
        suppliers don't usually stock USB A-to-A cables, which are technically
        non-standard equipment with undefined behavior in the USB
        specification.
      </p>
      <p>
        As an aside, I actually already had a USB A-to-A cable, funnily enough.
        I had gotten one for $1 from a bargain bin in a local computer store
        and used it to write third party firmware (<a href="https://github.com/keirf/FlashFloppy">
          FlashFloppy</a>) to a
        <a href="http://www.gotekemulator.com/">Gotek</a> floppy drive emulator
        for use in my Amiga 500. So that's handy, since I have a backup if
        anything happens to this one. I sort of wish the cable was coiled,
        but obviously there's very little real world demand for that,
        especially in A-to-A form factor. It's just a "nice-to-have."
      </p>
      <p>
        The last item in the box was a long length spacebar in the "bright
        white" color. I do not like the shortened spacebar and awkward alt
        key on this board (nor indeed do I like Windows keys at all, since
        they advertise a product I do not want to use outside of work), so
        while I still need to order a couple more keycaps to get everything
        matching, the spacebar was enough to get me most of the way there.
        I had to bend the stabilizer bar out a tiny bit to get it to swivel
        freely, since it was rubbing on the clips of the key itself. No big
        deal.
      </p>
      <a href="./unicomp_1/full/UT40E7A_0001034_02.jpg"><img src="./unicomp_1/UT40E7A_0001034_02.jpg" alt="My Unicomp Mini M, with shell removed, showing the keys I replaced."/></a>
      <imgcentercaption>
        My Unicomp Mini M, naked. Also shows the keycaps I replaced. I'll
        get the right colors soon!
      </imgcentercaption>
      <p>
        Notice how the alt keys have green legends, akin to the PS/2 enhanced
        keyboards of old. That's a nice touch; I just wish they'd have kept
        the right windows key <a href="https://www.pckeyboard.com/page/product/NEW_M">where it is on their Classic 104 and even their
          "New Model M"</a> (slightly better picture <a href="https://www.pckeyboard.com/mm5/graphics/00000001/Update%20and%20Announcement%20v_1.4.htm">
          here</a> [<a href="https://www.pckeyboard.com/mm5/graphics/00000001/Update%20and%20Announcement%20v_1.4.pdf">PDF</a>]),
        so I could cover
        it up without having to remap the right alt key in software and buy
        another full-width one with green legend to match the left alt key.
        I opened a support ticket, though, and Unicomp gave me instructions on
        how to order the exact caps I needed. So good on them, overall.
      </p>
      <p>
        I didn't ask about remapping, since I think they probably won't just
        give me source code and instructions on how to reprogram their
        microcontroller, but as I plan to mention later in this write-up it
        appears that the controller does use flash memory and should therefore
        be reprogrammable, at least in theory. The trouble might be that I
        don't know if it'll be possible to read the old firmware off of it.
      </p>
      <p>
        I know people complained about the other keyboard layout, too, so I
        guess Unicomp just can't win no matter what they do. Ideally I'd have
        no Windows keys there at all, mimicing the original SSK, but since I've
        got those spots I'm going to make one of them a compose key and
        another one legendless.
      </p>
      <h3>Remapping the Right Windows/Right Alt Keys (Linux-Specific)</h3>
      <p>
        The first method I tried to remap the right alt and windows keys works,
        but only in X11, and while it is keyboard-specific (does not mess up
        the mappings on other keyboards, such as the built-in laptop keyboard)
        it is hard to replicate easily so I'm just going to mention it briefly.
      </p>
      <p>
        It uses 'xkbcomp' to compile new keyboard definitions on a per-keyboard
        basis to remap the keys. You basically have to find the keyboard's
        ID according to x (using xinput) and then add 'swap_ralt_rwin' to
        the 'xkb_symbols' list.
      </p>
      <p>
        The second, <b>better</b> method works inside of X and in consoles,
        and so is preferable. It also works on a per-keyboard basis by using
        udev hwdb rules.
      </p>
      <p>
        Long story short, you can create a file called
        '/etc/udev/hwdb.d/99-unicomp.hwdb' containing the following code.
        Create directories as necessary to create the file.
      </p>
      <pre class="block">evdev:input:b0003v17F6p1862*
 KEYBOARD_KEY_700e6=rightmeta
 KEYBOARD_KEY_700e7=rightalt</pre>
      <p>
        then, as root, run:
      </p>
      <pre class="block"># udevadm hwdb --update</pre>
      <p>
        On systemd systems, I have read that 'udevadm hwdb' is deprecated, but
        it still works on my Debian system which is using hwdb <i>without</i>
        the rest of systemd active.
      </p>
      <p>
        It was kind of tricky to figure out how to do write this file, but if
        you are curious, try to look up 'hwdb keyboard remapping' or similar
        in a search engine.
      </p>
      <h3>BLUE LED'S, AAARGH</h3>
      <p>
        It seems that some time in the last year, Unicomp started using blue
        LED's in its keyboards. This is bad, because they're too bright,
        because <a href="https://www.webmd.com/sleep-disorders/sleep-blue-light">
          blue keeps you up at night</a>, and because it's utterly inauthentic
        for a keyboard with a 1980's design to have blue LED's, when blue LED's
        weren't even created until the late 90's or early 2000's. Green or
        amber would both have been preferable choices.
      </p>
      <p>
        To make things worse, normally I'd just desolder them, buuut this time
        they're tiny surface mount things mounted directly on the keyboard
        membrane. So that's not good.
      </p>
      <p>
        I plan to do something like I did when I put a PS/2 model M controller
        board inside a terminal M, where I soldered a header to the board's
        pins that connected to the LED's on the matrix of the PS/2 keyboard
        matrix and then ran a cable to a perfboard I slapped some LED's on.
        I think that should work fine here, too. I'll probably update this page
        when I finally do it.
      </p>
      <p>
        I might write more here soon, mentioning another little issue I've
        noticed where the controller board gets pretty warm, but I'll save it
        for later. I've been writing this for entirely too long now.
      </p>
      <h3>Addressing Some Common Complaints People Make about Unicomp &amp; Buckling Spring keyboards</h3>
      <h4>(Not specifically the Mini M)</h4>
      <p>
        These are some common complaints I read about Unicomp keyboards, and
        sometimes about buckling springs or mechanical keyboards as a whole.
        I'm using this as a place to address the complaints and give my two
        cents on them. I'm not trying to defend any particular person or group
        here, and I could definitely be wrong about some things (like legend
        printing techniques). So if you spot anything wrong, You could make an
        issue on this site's issue tracker (currently on <a href="https://github.com/wyatt8740/site/issues">
          GitHub</a>).
      </p>
      <h4>Poorly Printed Key Legends</h4>
      <p>
        I can't say much here, except that the legends on my board look pretty
        good to me. Sure, if I A/B it with an early 90's IBM M, I might say
        that the positioning on the "pause" and "end" key printing is a bit
        low, but that's only when comparing it directly to another keyboard.
        In practice, I don't spend most of my time looking at my keyboard, so
        I honestly don't notice or care.
      </p>
      <p>
        All the rest of the keys on the board, however, look absolutely fine
        to my eyes, and I only noticed 'Pause' and 'End' when I went looking
        for them. I find it easy to forget about again since it really does
        not impact my typing experience.
      </p>
      <p>
        The other complaint I've seen lodged against Unicomp seems to be an
        older one, but there were reports of what sounds like "overspray,"
        basically blurry printing. I definitely do not see blurry printing
        on this board, though. It looks thick and crisp and solid. So
        either I got really lucky, or they've corrected this issue.
      </p>
      <h4>Noisy</h4>
      <p>
        Unicomp's detractors tend to complain about the noise of the boards,
        but in my personal opinion, this is totally missing the point of a
        buckling spring keyboard.</p>
      <p>
        While it is <b>certainly</b> valid to not want a keyboard on account of
        the noise it makes, If you need a quiet board, and you <i>really</i>
        need a quiet board, I think you should maybe get a rubber-dome board.
        Maybe a scissor switch, laptop-style one. Those are pretty nice
        feeling and they make far, far less noise.
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>Any</i> mechanical switch or buckling spring board will inherently
        be noisier than that, although buckling springs are admittedly
        especially loud. Even my Apple Extended Keyboard, which is a tactile,
        non-clicky design that I love, is louder by far than a rubber dome Sun
        keyboard or any non-gaming offering from Logitech. So again, my
        opinion is that if you don't like the noise, they simply aren't for
        you. Get a scissor switch keyboard, or maybe even try a
        <a href="https://deskthority.net/wiki/Topre_switch">Topre</a> board.
        I've not used a Topre, but apparently they feel extremely nice, and
        they use a variant on the rubber dome design.

      <h4>No backlighting</h4>
      <p>
        My personal reaction whenever i see this complaint is pretty
        straightforward. I think that if you're on your keyboard a lot, and
        you've been using keyboards for a few years, you probably know how
        to touch-type. Even in darkness, I can typically find keys with ease
        and without looking down, at least if the keyboard uses a standardized
        or mostly-standardized layout. Every common (non-122-key) Model M I've
        ever seen has had pretty much the standard "IBM Enhanced Keyboard"
        layout, so I don't really get why the lack of backlighting is an
        issue for so many people.        
      </p>
      <p>
        The only ways I can think of to justify "needing" backlighting are:
        <ol>
          <li>You're new to typing and are in the dark a lot,</li>
          <li>You're on a strange keyboard layout and haven't adapted to
              it yet, or</li>
          <li>You like the aesthetic to such an extent that you won't buy
              a keyboard if it hasn't got it.</li>
        </ol>
        If your reason is liking the backlit aesthetic (which I will admit
        is neat), and that's your only reason for not wanting a buckling spring
        board, I'd like to ask why you're spending so much time looking at your
        keyboard rather than using it. Everyone likes things for different
        reasons, sure, but as a utilitarian I'd just see backlighting as a
        nice bonus rather than an essential feature.
      </p>
      <p>
        Additionally, it's worth noting that the buckling spring mechanism
        itself contains no provisions for backlighting, on account of having
        been designed between the 1970's (first patent) and the mid-80's,
        and implementing backlighting would be a major challenge, if not
        completely impossible.
      </p>
      <p>
        The <i>only way</i> I can think of to implement backlighting involves,
        at a minimum, a complete redesign of the keycap to use double-shot
        injection moulding (expensive) or clear plastic with paint that will
        eventually wear off (less expensive, but of subpar quality in my
        opinion). Then, you'd have to put over one hundred surface-mounted
        LED's on each keyboard's membrane, lined up so that they inhabit
        what I'd guess is a one or two  millimeter gap between the top of the
        rocking pivot/hammer assembly and the upper edge of the barrel plate.
        And that's all assuming that the key stem itself won't collide with the
        LED when a key is pressed! It's really <b>not</b> a design suitable for
        backlighting, but as I've said, if you can touch type I don't really
        think it's a huge issue.

      <h4>No black keys with white legends</h4>
      <p>
        This one is <b>totally valid</b> as a criticism,
        although I can see both sides of this story, too.
      </p>
      <p>
        Unicomp's reasoning for not offering white legends on black keys is
        pretty reasonable, in my opinion. They cite that the printing process
        they use on their boards is dye sublimation, which only works by adding
        pigments to light key colors (additive printing). Imagine trying to
        print on black paper with a normal consumer printer (which typically
        has only cyan, magenta, yellow, and black inks). That's the challenge
        that they are facing.
      </p>
      <p>
        The way that black keyboards usually have legends added is
        with either lasering (the ability to print white on black with a laser
        is relatively new, though), pad printing, double-shot injection
        moulding, or possibly something like silk screening. Pad printing is
        basically just stamping paint onto the black plastic. It works, but
        it will wear down with heavy use, and requires pad printing machinery,
        which can be expensive to purchase and maintain and is less permanent
        than dye sublimation. I used to work at a factory with pad printing
        machines (although they were not designed for keyboard printing and
        had pads far too small to print all keyboard keys at once), so I might
        have a somewhat better understanding than some do, but typically
        you can even scrape pad printing off with a plastic knife. The legends
        absolutely would not hold up in the long run like other Model M's
        legends have.
      </p>
      <p>
        Pad printing was used on the old Model M13, the only Model M with
        legends that was ever offered in black to my knowledge. Many have
        faded legends by now. I do not think pad printing is as common
        these days, having been supplanted by other technologies, but I cannot
        be sure of that. It is sometimes hard to telll by visual inspection
        alone. Edgar Matias (who actually manufactures keyboards) <a href="https://geekhack.org/index.php?topic=45483.msg1090654#msg1090654">
          claims</a> that pad printing is not very common anymore.
      </p>
      <p>
        I am not as familiar with silk screening, but I see It is something
        I think I need to research more. Some people on the same thread I
        linked above claim that silk screening is not viable on keyboards,
        so I don't really know what to think there.
      </p>
      <p>
        The alternative would be dye sublimating all but the legends of white
        keys in black, which I'd imagine would be time consuming and deliver
        non-uniform results across the keys.
      </p>
      <p>
        With that said, none of that is a reason Unicomp should actually be
        <b>incapable</b> of doing pad printing; if the demand is there
        (and it might well be; people like black keyboards), I think
        many could still buy boards, even understanding those limitations of
        the process. I don't think I'd buy one personally, though. If I could
        have, I'd have gotten my mini M in beige plastic to match my
        collection of IBM keyboards. :)
