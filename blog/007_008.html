      </h2>
      <p><i>01 Feb 2022</i> [<a class="permalink" href="./007_008.html#powerbook-linux-1">Permanent link</a>]<br/>
        It's First post of 2022, and it's also my first post that isn't about
        about technology!
      </p>
      <p>
        …Well, okay. That's a lie. It <i>kind of</i> is. It's just more about
        science fiction and theoretical situations.
      </p>
      <p>
        This post (unless it derails as I write it) will be about an anime from
        1987, specifically one episode from 1989, and the thoughts that it
        provoked.
      </p>
      <p>
        Note that I <b>very rarely</b> actually watch anime. I think this might
        be the first one I've watched since around 2015 or 2016. I read manga
        slightly more frequently, but a lot of it makes me feel uncomfortable
        with how it treats and portrays people - women in particular, when
        it comes to shonen stuff.
      </p>
      <p>
        Yes, I am aware of the irony in talking about treatment of women when
        I'm watching a show basically about "soldier girls" with armor that has
        boob plate (which shouldn't actually be necessary, functionally, and
        might endanger the sternum, should it crumple). I'm going to ignore
        this in favor of talking about the thing that actually interests me
        about this episode.
      </p>
      <h3>A Spoiler Warning</h3>
      <p>
        If you enjoy manga or anime, especially from the 80's or 90's, or if
        you liked <i>Blade Runner</i>, <i>Do Androids Dream of Electric
        Sheep</i>, or <i>Chobits</i> a lot, I would suggest and recommend that
        you stop reading this post for now, and go watch the show up to this
        episode (or at least watch the episode itself), and then return before
        I spoil it for you. I was glad to experience this with nothing spoiled
        for me. It made it easier for me to have reflections on it that are
        genuinely my own.
      </p>
      <p>
        …Well, okay. That might also be a partial lie. Even though I was not
        spoiled on this episode, I <i>have</i> already been deeply influenced
        by things like <i>Astro Boy</i> (the manga), <i>Karakuri Odette</i>
        (the shojo manga), and the aforementioned <i>Chobits</i>. Those are
        three manga I've read specifically because they touch on the subject
        matter this episode focuses on, and each in its own way. Maybe I'll
        make this into a series of posts.
      </p>
      <p>
        Also, do note: I have not finished the series. Episode 5 was so good
        that I had to take a breather, and I also re-watched it a couple times.
        The episode feels like it has a lot to pack into its time window, but
        the ideas are strong. If more stuff happens on this topic (I think
        there's a decent chance of it – but there's only three more episodes
        to go…), I will be over the moon.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you don't want to watch all of it, at least watch episode 1 (which
        is longer than any of the others) to get an idea of the characters and
        setting. Actually, you don't even have to do that; I think you'll get
        an idea for the general setting and names of things if you watch the
        opening performance (about five minutes).
      </p>
      <p>
        With the exception of the very beginning of the opening, before the
        song kicks in (which I liked a lot; it was very atmospheric and gave a
        sense for the scale of things), this video on YouTube has the entire
        thing.

        Sorry for the lower than normal resolution. I don't want to get any

      <h3>Reflections</h3>
      <p>
        So, Hello, and welcome; Welcome, to those of you who have no
        inclination to watch the show at any point. Welcome, those who have
        seen it already. And finally, I extend a warm welcome to theoretical
        person out there who wants to hear what some random guy in Indiana
        thinks thinks about an episode of a TV show that came out seven years
        before he was born. Thanks for listening to my shouts into the void.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you fit in one or more of those categories, then I dont know how you
        came by this blog, but you are now embarked upon a journey that must
        certainly lead you to change your life <i>forever</i>! If you were
        never a special person, you are a special person now. <i>Hello,
        seeker!</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        Anyway, I don't have a plan in mind when I start writing these, so I
        am sorry if I start to "ramble" too much. I just wanted to
        get this out there to try to express myself better. Apologies also for
        the bizarre detour into
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Everything_You_Know_Is_Wrong">
          The Firesign Theatre</a> just now. The real reflections begin after
        the break.

      <h3>Analysis</h3>
      <p>
        I might need to put a table of contents here, but we'll see how long
        this drags out.

      <p>
        I am going to try to avoid just turning this into a plot summary. If
        you want to know about the plot, I suggest you watch the episode. It
        does a nice job explaining things for the viewer, in my opinion. I've
        shared this episode with a handful of friends, and they all seem to
        agree that everything comes together pretty cleanly.
      </p>
      <p>
        The crux of this "topic" that I kept harping on about without properly
        defining above is that of what we call 'human' – and how important
        is it to be biologically a human in order to be accepted as one. Should
        they be given a separate status? Does one have to be alive to be a
        human? How do we define "life?" Are sterile people "alive" despite not
        being able to reproduce? I would say they are, but the commonly
        accepted scientific definition I was taught in schools says otherwise.
      </p>
      <p>
        In short, then, we are addressing the quintessential "what does
        it mean to be human?" question.
      </p>
      <p>
        My theory is that people consider other things to be "people" based
        on our ingrained social behaviors and our desires to interact with
        others. Most of us don't function well in complete isolation. If I
        could be a total shut-in, and have all the time to do my tinkering with
        electronics or whatever, but I could never invite someone over or go to
        see anyone else, I'd rapidly become depressed. It has happened to a
        lot of us during this unending COVID-19 pandemic, myself included. But
        no matter how much I do need <i>some</i> degree of social interaction,
        it can often be supplemented by the sorts of attachments we get to
        inanimate objects and non-human animals.
      </p>
      <p>
        People can get attached to all kinds of things that aren't humans.
        People often feel that they are friends with their pets (especially
        dogs), and others have hobbies and passions like a musical instrument,
        or painting, or even working on a project car. I was devastated when
        my silver '91 Volvo got wrecked. Not only because I was out a car, but
        because I was out <i>that</i> car. I'd spent a lot of time and effort
        making it as good as I could - trying to ward off the rust, hand-drying
        it after a wash, and generally <i>taking better care of it than I took
          of myself</i>. I think this is related to the idea of "imprinting."
      </p>
      <p>
        This behavior of imprinting, and of applying our own emotions or
        thought processes to explain the behaviors of other animals, is part
        of why I think people can be so sentimental (which I think is a good
        thing). But there's a strange thing that I and many others have
        noticed, where the closer something is to looking like us, the more
        we get unnerved by it. This is termed the "uncanny valley." That is,
        the closer to human something gets, the more we fear it as
        <i>in</i>human– at least to a point. After that point, they are
        imperceptibly different, and they become effectively seen as people.
      </p>

      <p>
        Boomers (ブーマ, "buma") in Bubblegum Crisis seem to exist on both
        sides of this uncanny valley. Many of them appear normal, but then
        their skin comes off (all the time), or metal blades slide out of their
        fingernails (episode 2, I believe), or they turn into some form of huge
        twisted metal monstrosity (episode 1), and things become incredibly
        unsettling. But those experiences in past episodes are why I find
        Sylvie, and this whole episode, so interesting. 
      </p>

      <p>
        They took the anthropomorphization of robots to a level I'd never even
        thought of before, by giving them blood. Sure, I've seen
        <i>Terminator</i>, and I remember that gruesome scene. But there, it
        was played for the unease. Not so much here. It's done so that you
        might not be sure what you're seeing at first. At the very least, I was
        somewhat confused.

      <imgcentercaption>Self-sacrifice is something new for Boomers in this
        show.</imgcentercaption>

      <p>
        Similarly, Shigesato Itoi once said that the logo for the game
        <i>Mother 3</i> was a fusion of metal and wood because it feels
        unnatural and makes you uneasy (and also because of the Chimerae that
        are all over in the game). I can see what he means.
      </p>

      <p>
        By the way, I can't stand things like "Siri."
      </p>
      
      <p>
        In <i>Bubblegum Crisis</i>, the really interesting thing is that
        <b>they never let you see what these particular characters look like
        </b> under the skin. I think this was deliberate. The sparks in this
        scene are enough to suggest they might be robots, but the blood makes
        you unsure. I think the overall point is to make people worry about it,
        but in the end there's just so much human vulnerability that they show
        compared to all of the other varieties of Boomers we've seen so far.
        They are fragile. Whereas with alot of boomers just taking the head off
        isn't enough to stop them, these ones can bleed out. They appear to
        feel pain, sorrow, guilt, and a range of other emotions.
      </p>

      <p>
        To me, it feels cruel to give them such sentimentality and fragility.
        Especially because it means we're just offloading our own burdens onto
        something else so that they can do something for us. We give them
        feelings, both ability to feel pain and emotions, and then we force
        them to serve our needs. In the case of these robots, they were meant
        for sex, which is why they had to feel warm to the touch and have
        something like blood. So, given that you percieve them as human or
        sufficiently close, it seems clear that they are basically "born" into
        sex slavery. I mean, <i>maybe</i> that would help solve the "human
        trafficking" problem, but if we make them like this, then what really
        changed? Nothing– except that now we can feel better about degrading
        them and treating them as objects.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        To me, at least, that's a sickening concept. Especially because, if
        AI can get that far, I could actually see this happening in the future
        (even if not by 2032, necessarily). The power of money is such that I
        am certain someone would come forward to fill that market.
      </p>

      <p>
        On the subject of emotions, it might be time to bring up <i>Chobits</i>
        now. The major take-away I had from it was that in the end, even if
        their 'feelings' were programmed by a person, if they feel real to
        others, and they react appropriately in the right situations, does
        the distinction really matter?
        
      </p>

      
      
      <p>
        But, no matter how much we tend to anthropomorphize objects and other,
        non-'human' animals, we (well, most of us) are not really seeing them
        as equals, with all of the same rights that we have. When you think
        about it, it seems probable that a fully grown dog or dolphin would be
        smarter and more "sapient" than a newborn baby, right? They have
        experienced some part of the world, and certainly have more of an idea
        of what it is than a newborn. But because babies tend to become
        more sapient over time, and also tend to become "adults" eventually,
        they are given higher priority. This is understandable, since it's
        as much an instinctual thing as it is a social thing to care for your
        own child.
      </p>
      <p>
        But, what if what you deem to be your child wasn't actually considered
        to be a person at all?
      </p>
      <p>
        
      </p>
      <p>
        I am not about to 
      </p>


      <p>
        I kind of had a bad feeling about what was going to happen to Sylvie,
        starting pretty early on in the episode. She was a new character,
        and in previous episodes I had noticed that that isn't a good sign in
        this show. I think most of them have died, so far - with the exception
        of the <strike class="strike">old man</strike> – Sorry, <i>Hasage</i>,
        J.B. Gibson, and his girlfriend, from the previous episode.
      </p>
      <p>
        This brings me to some comparisons to other media that might be of
        interest to you, especially if you also enjoyed this episode. I feel
        like I'll probably be pulling in a few other bits of media that I
        consider relevant.
      </p>
      <h4>Comparisons with <i>Phantasy Star II</i> (1989)</h4>
      <alert><br/>WARNING:</br>
      The following section contains major spoilers for <i>Phantasy Star II</i>
      for the Sega Mega Drive/Genesis.</alert>
    <p>
      Now, in my opinion, the game itself
      isn't very fun, but I love the story and character designs. So if you
      actually want to torture yourself playing it like I did, you should
      probably skip to the "end-of-spoiler" header below.
    </p>
      <p>
        I hoped I was wrong, of course. But, I mean, I played <i>Phantasy Star
          II</i>. That game has a very similar moody and dark feel to it,
        like this episode (that was released in the same year).

          Anri, bleeding. This episode does a great job of blurring the line
          where machines end and people begin.<br/>
          The rationale for why they'd have blood also worked well. It was
          such a brilliant idea and execution that I'm still freaking out
          about it a little.

        ----Article under construction----
        * Bleeding: blurs the line between humans and robots further.
        An excellent literary device.
        
        * First time in the series I can remember that robots have been
        proper protagonists. I was starting to wonder. Though I guess
        Cynthia was sort of a victim.
        
        * It's incredibly cruel to make something, give it essentially life
        (the ability to make its own decisions, to learn, everything short
        of reproduction) and then essentially enslave it - in this case,
        sexually. Is it any better than enslaving a biological human?
        
        * Obviously, robots don't have to follow the "three laws," so some
        at least are very close to being people. I would consider them
        people. Sylvie died a human.
        
        * They made the conscious decision to never show the mechanics under
        Sylvie's skin.
        
        * The cat. How lonely must it feel to know you aren't "really" a
        person, but having to either completely ignore that side of yourself
        or else risk losing people you care about?
        Sylvie's sad stare when the cat is hissing at her says so much for me
        without her actually having to say anything at all.
        
        * The red eye thing. Apparently boomers like Sylvie can do things
        that human's can't, too. I think that is the only time they
        show Sylvie act distinctly inhuman in the entire episode. It's good
        that they put it in there, because it is sort of the Astro Boy
        thing. I think she wants to belong.

        * It's strange that they portrayed her so sympathetically when she
        is literally murdering people for their blood. She killed tons of
        people so that one person (yes, I'm calling Anri a person, based on
        the assumption she has a little depth like Sylvie did) could live.
        She acted like she was maybe a bit guilty about it at the club, but
        not enough to stop doing it.

        * Even if their emotions aren't "real" any more than human chemical
        ones, and even if they **are** simpler than human ones, why does that
        make what they think any less important?

        * Why do we have to make robots in humanoid shapes, for that matter?

        * In the end, Anri wanted Sylvie to stop, so she cared about humans.
        One can assume Sylvie also did, in the end, since she asked to be
        killed to stop the bomb from going off.

        * I guess it's sort of like the actual vampires in things like Anne
        Rice books, who often hate who they are and what they have to do to
        survive. Or even out of an obligation to help someone else.

        * Not the first time I've seen someone get murdered and leave a
        bloody mess, though. Mason in episode 3(?) is killed in an act of
        apparent vigilante justice by Sylia.

        * Was Leon conscious for this? did he discover (for real this time)
        who the Knight Sabers were?

        * I should mention Karakuri Odette and Chobits here, somewhere.

        holds the keys that let you survive, that level of power over you is

        * What's up with Daley? I think I know, but I'm not certain. Not
        that it especially matters for the episode, but Daley is certainly
        a character. Does he have a relationship with Leon, or is he just
        hitting on Leon? Does that mean Leon is bisexual?
        - Why does this matter so much to me?
        - Oh, right, because 1980's Japanese culture (and even some of the
          present culture) is often homophobic.

        (derailing a little) The art style is gorgeous.
