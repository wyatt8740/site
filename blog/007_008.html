        It's my first post of 2022, and it's also my first post that isn't about
        about technology!
      </p>
      <p>
        …Well, okay. That's a lie. It <i>kind of</i> is about technology. It's
        just more about science fiction, theoretical situations, and
        philosophy. I did originally <a href="../index.html">say</a> I might
        not do much non-tech stuff on my site, but here we are. Something
        finally motivated me to do a thought dump on philosophy.
      </p>
      <p>
        This post is primarily about an anime from 1987– specifically, one
        episode from 1989– and the thoughts that it provoked, both as I
        watched it and afterwards upon reflection. It hit me harder than
        anything I've watched has in a very long time. It elevated the series
        from being "something with an art style I appreciate" to being "one of
        the best things I've seen."

                <p>
                  Note that I <b>very rarely</b> actually watch anime. I think this might
                  be the first one I've watched since around 2015 or 2016. I read manga
                  slightly more frequently, but a lot of it makes me feel uncomfortable
                  with how it treats people. Particularly discomforting for me is some
                  of the ways it treats women, when it comes to shonen stuff.
                  <i>Shonen</i> here refers to manga that primarily targets male
                  teens. To a lesser extent, it can target young adults as well.
                </p>
      <p>
        I'd like to make a brief shoutout to <i>Gintama</i> for being pretty
        respectful, while also still managing to be hilarious and irreverent.
        Haven't watched the anime, but this is at least true of the manga.
      </p>
      <p>
        ...Anyway, yes, I am aware of the irony in talking about treatment of
        women when I'm watching a show basically about "soldier girls" with
        armor that has boob plate (which shouldn't actually be necessary,
        functionally, and might endanger the sternum, should it crumple). I'm
        going to ignore this in favor of talking about the thing that actually
        interests me about this episode.
      </p>-->
      <!--      <p>
                Note that I do not watch very much anime; it's often distasteful and
                treats and portrays people badly (especially women). On account
                of that, I think this is the first one I've watched in about eight
                years. This is something very different, though. It showcases a more
                thoughtful side of the cartoon medium, and "Moonlight Rambler" does so
                without the overt sexualization I tend to expect in it (it's
                refreshing to see). The people feel like people, and I appreciate it
                immensely. I hope I can find more stuff that takes this approach, but
                it seems to go against current commercial trends so I might be waiting
                a while.
                </p>-->
      <h3 id="rambler_foreword">Foreword/Spoiler Warning</h3>
      <p>
        If you enjoy manga or anime, especially from the 80's or 90's, or if
        you liked <i>Blade Runner</i>/<i>Do Androids Dream of Electric
          Sheep</i> (or <i>Chobits</i>) a lot, I would suggest and recommend that
        you stop reading this post for now, and go watch the show up to this
        episode (or at least watch the episode itself), and then return before
        I spoil it for you. I was glad to experience this with nothing spoiled
        for me. It made it easier for me to have reflections on it that are
        genuinely my own.
      </p>
      <p>
        …Well, okay. That might also be a partial lie. Even though I was not
        spoiled on this episode, I <i>have</i> already been deeply influenced
        by things like <i>Astro Boy</i> (the manga), <i>Karakuri Odette</i>
        (the shojo manga), and the aforementioned <i>Chobits</i>. Those are
        three manga I've read specifically because they touch on the subject
        matter this episode focuses on, and each in its own way. Maybe I'll
        make this into a series of posts.
      </p>
      <p>
        I will also be spoiling details of other literary works and video
        games, so proceed with caution.
      </p>
      <p>
        Also, do note: I have not finished the series. Episode 5 was so good
        that I had to take a breather, and I also re-watched it a couple times.
        The episode feels like it has a lot to pack into its time window, but
        the ideas are strong. If more stuff happens on this topic (I think
        there's a decent chance of it – but there's only three more episodes
        to go…), I will be over the moon.
      </p>
      <p>
        I often actually <i>dislike</i> science fiction for its tendency to
        focus on fancy looking technology, terror/horror, or other
        sensationalism, overlooking the philosophical questions of humanity
        that great science fiction can effectively reflect on. If you'd like
        to know what I consider 'great science fiction,' I'd say Ray Bradbury
        was good at writing that discussed things in very relatable human terms
        (<i>The Martian Chronicles</i>, <i>Fahrenheit 451</i>), as was Kurt
        Vonnegut (<i>Cat's Cradle</i>). It's the ability to connect humanity as
        it is now to the future - and recognize that regardless of when we live,
        people will still be people for better and worse - that distinguishes
        'great science fiction.' I think this episode does that with aplomb.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you don't want to watch all of it, at least watch episode 1 (which
        is longer than any of the others) to get an idea of the characters and
        setting. Actually, you don't even have to do that; I think you'll get
        an idea for the general setting and names of things if you watch the
        opening performance (about five minutes).
      </p>
      <p>
        With the exception of the very beginning of the opening, before the
        song kicks in (which I liked a lot; it was very atmospheric and gave a
        sense for the scale of things), this video on YouTube has the entire
        thing. This video is also the thing that made me decide I wanted to try
        watching this anime. It's pretty rare for me to make that decision, but
        I am just enamored with the art style of this show (and much of the
        other manga and anime of the time period). The fact that it is all
        hand drawn and colored just adds to the appeal; this series has
        gorgeous colors and a fantastic setting.

        Sorry for the lower than normal resolution. I don't want to get any
        trouble (not that I think anyone would really DMCA me for one or two
        higher resolution shots - but you never can tell). At least this way,
        I can claim "fair use." I also submit to the copyright holder(s) that
        this series doesn't get very much attention, being over 30 years old,
        and so you might want to just consider this free marketing.
      </p>
      <p>
        So, Hello, and welcome; Welcome, to those of you who have no
        inclination to watch the show at any point. Welcome, those who have
        seen it already. And finally, I extend a warm welcome to theoretical
        person out there who wants to hear what some random guy in Indiana
        thinks thinks about an episode of a TV show that came out seven years
        before he was born. Thanks for listening to my shouts into the void.

      <p>
        I am going to try to avoid just turning this into a plot summary. If
        you want to know about the plot, I suggest you watch the episode. It
        does a nice job explaining things for the viewer, in my opinion. I've
        shared this episode with a handful of friends, and they all seem to
        agree that everything comes together pretty cleanly.
      </p>
      <p>
        The crux of this topic that I kept harping on about, but never properly
        defined above, is of what can we call 'human?' I've had a few different
        lines of questioning come to mind while thinking about this episode and
        writing this post. I'll touch on a few of these, but I'll mention the
        rest in case the others get you thinking.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Is something's 'humanity' totally biologically based?</li>
        <ul>
          <li>People anthropomorphize lots of non-human things and project
            their thoughts onto them.</li>
          <li>Likewise, some biological humans do monstrously evil things
            to each other.</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Do you even have to be a human in order to have the rights of one
          in human society?</li>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Moreover, can humans be expected to adapt to such a reality? It
            seems like it would be so easy to just fear them.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <li>Should such robots be given a separate status? Does one have to be
          alive to be a human? How do we define "life?"</li>
        <li>Aren't sterile people "alive" despite not being able to reproduce?
          I would say they are, but the commonly accepted definition I was
          taught in school seems to say otherwise.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        In short, then, we are addressing the quintessential "what does
        it mean to be human?" question.
      </p>
      <p>
        My theory is that people consider other things to be "people" based
        on our ingrained social behaviors and our desires to interact with
        others. Most of us don't function well in complete isolation. If I
        could be a total shut-in, and have all the time to do my tinkering with
        electronics or whatever, but I could never invite someone over or go to
        see anyone else, I'd rapidly become depressed. It has happened to a
        lot of us during this unending COVID-19 pandemic, myself included. But
        no matter how much I do need <i>some</i> degree of social interaction,
        it can often be supplemented by the sorts of attachments we get to
        inanimate objects and non-human animals.
      </p>
      <p>
        People can get attached to all kinds of things that aren't humans.
        People often feel that they are friends with their pets (especially
        dogs), and others have hobbies and passions like a musical instrument,
        or painting, or even working on a project car. I was devastated when
        my silver '91 Volvo got wrecked. Not only because I was out a car, but
        because I was out <i>that</i> car. I'd spent a lot of time and effort
        making it as good as I could - trying to ward off the rust, hand-drying
        it after a wash, and generally <i>taking better care of it than I took
          of myself</i>. I think this is related to the idea of attachment
        formation, or maybe "imprinting."
      </p>

      <h4 id="rambler_uncanny">Overcoming the Uncanny Valley</h4>
      <p>
        This behavior of imprinting, and of applying our own emotions or
        thought processes to explain the behaviors of other animals, is part
        of why I think people can be so sentimental (which I think is a good
        thing). But there's a strange thing that I and many others have
        noticed, where the closer something is to looking like us, the more
        we get unnerved by it. This is termed the "uncanny valley." That is,
        the closer to human something gets, the more we fear it as
        <i>in</i>human– at least to a point. After that point, they are
        imperceptibly different, and they become effectively seen as people.
      </p>

      <p>
        Boomers (ブーマ, "buma") in Bubblegum Crisis seem to exist on both
        sides of this uncanny valley. Many of them appear normal, but then
        their skin comes off (all the time), or metal blades slide out of their
        fingernails (episode 2, I believe), or they turn into some form of huge
        twisted metal monstrosity (episode 1), and things become incredibly
        unsettling. But those experiences in past episodes are why I find
        Sylvie, and this whole episode, so interesting. 
      </p>

      
      <p>
        They took the anthropomorphization of robots to a level I'd never even
        thought of before, by giving them blood. Sure, I've seen
        <i>Terminator</i>, and I remember that gruesome scene. But there, it
        was played for the unease. Similarly, Shigesato Itoi once said that the
        logo for the game <i>Mother 3</i> was a fusion of metal and wood
        because it is an unnatural pairing, befitting the chimera that the game
        features. It was also intended to make people uneasy. I can see what he
        means; it's a weird dichotomy.
      </p>
      <p>
        Not so much here. Here, the fusion of (wo)man and machine is done so
        deeply that you might not even be sure what you're seeing at first. At
        the very least, I was uncertain for much of the episode. By hiding the
        robotic parts of these boomers, <i>Bubblegum Crisis</i> forces the
        viewer to anthropomorphize them by default. The discomfort is avoided,
        because we can't see the metal that would make us uneasy. Instead, all
        we see is blood and the other things that we would typically associate
        with biological humans.
      </p>
      <h4 id="rambler_altruism">Altruism &amp; Self-Sacrifice</h4>
      <p>
        Nam/Namu(?), the other gray haired girl near the beginning of the
        episode, and also seen below, displays an act of pure altruism when
        she pushes Sylvie and Anri into the ship as debris falls from above,
        sacrificing herself in the process.

      </imgcentercaption>
      <p>
        I've heard different theories (mostly from NPR's Radiolab program,
        and TED talks) about why people act altruistically. One I've heard
        multiple times is that "<i>it helps to ensure that the species as a
          whole survives</i>." I think that's a load of garbage. We are social
        creatures, and while it may be fair to say that a lot of things we do
        as groups are evolutionarily inclined, if there was a "self-sacrifice
        gene" one would expect that it would be naturally removed from the gene
        pool relatively quickly. Not everything we do has to have cold,
        rational explanations.
      </p>
      <p>
        I think this kind of sacrifice is an independent thought. I'm sure
        there are some that have done it because they don't value their lives
        as highly as someone else's, or, in Spock's words, because "the good
        of the many outweighs the needs of a few" (or one). But for me, I don't
        think I have the right kind of mind to coldly analyze costs and
        benefits when a truck is barrelling towards my friend.
      </p>
      <p>
        Putting myself in these shoes, I think the only thing I'd think is
        "I don't want to see my friend(s) get hurt." I don't even think I'd
        get as far as "how can I live with myself otherwise" before it would
        be too late to do anything but watch.

      <imgcentercaption>The strange dichotomy of blood and electricity is on
        display here, if only for a moment.
        <br/>We also see their remarkable fragility - at least when compared to
        the boomers from episode 1 that can move without a head.
      </imgcentercaption>
      <p>
        The moment above is the moment when my brain started running at
        full-tilt. I wasn't sure if what I was seeing was simply something
        "electrified came down from above", or if it was a sign of something
        else. Having just seen what I consider to be the ultimate act of love,
        Seeing the blood, feeling the sinking in my stomach, and then seeing
        the unexpected sparks "sparked" something in me.
      </p>
      <p>
        Unlike the discomfort I felt in the case of Mother 3, here (well,
        really later in the episode, I was still unsure at this moment) I felt
        something more complicated. It reminded me a bit of the feeling I
        sometimes can get when I hear a truly beautiful piece of music.
        I experienced something that was beautiful in its sadness— something
        cathartic, even. I think some would call it "divine," but I didn't
        feel like I was connected to a higher power or anything. I just felt
        a huge knot of emotional turmoil.
      </p>
      <p>
        This feeling of awe (and anticipation) continued to grow throughout the
        entire episode from this point. I knew it was going to end in tears – I
        just wanted to know how it would get there. But my sadness grew
        alongside my awe throughout the episode. Even as I write this,
        about a month after first watching it, I still feel something.
      </p>
      <p>
        In short, it was an extremely bittersweet feeling, the kind that I get
        when I witness something beautiful. It felt like it filled some void
        I didn't know I had... in the end, it's the kind of thing I wish I
        could cry more about, because the crying feels so good. I hope I'm
        making sense.
      </p>
      <p>
        I wouldn't necessarily call it "sadness," because I love this imagery.
        It's sort of a sublimely beautiful idea for me, for reasons I don't
        feel totally equipped to explain.
      </p>
      <p>
        Anyway, the moment depicted in the image above is also the moment when
        this episode started signalling to me that it was going to have a very
        different tone than the previous ones. I noticed the spark coming from
        her back; I sort of just assumed it was because something that fell was
        electrified, but at this point, my mind also started entertaining an
        alternative explanation: that the electricity came from inside Namu.
        Since this is one of my favorite things to think about, I started
        feeling excited as well. It's what I'd been hoping this series would do
        since the beginning.
      </p>
      <p>
        Actually, the show had already come sort of close on one prior
        occasion. In the opening of episode 2 ("<i>Born to Kill</i>"), it felt
        very clear to me that Genom was essentially desecrating the grave of a
        young girl and stealing from her corpse. I can't imagine that it
        wasn't on purpose. Sylia even said "to us, she was just a little girl
        who needed protecting;" I think she even said that next time they
        should make the robot look like a dog instead.

      <h4 id="rambler_kill">Born to Kill?</h4>
      <p>
        Up to this point in the show, Boomers had only really been portrayed as
        monsters wearing human skin (with the possible exception of Cynthia,
        who we really didn't get much personality from before her demise in the
        first episode). The other boomers in episode 1 didn't seem to mind much
        when their companions were destroyed; they seemed to not have anything
        like an emotional attachment to each other.
      </p>

      <p>
        But this episode suggested an alternative future for robots. Instead
        of being war machines, they could be a sort of extension of humanity.
        The "33S" type robots are physically fragile things by comparison, but
        with willpower as strong as any person's.
      </p>

      <p>
        These robots are clearly not made to be fighters. They were made to
        seem as human-like as possible, which was done so well that they even
        die like humans. When Lou (blonde) gets injured by the Doberman
        (basically a killer robot sent to prevent their escape), Meg runs to
        her. In the face of certain death, instead of running, Meg pulls lou
        closer.

      <p>
        This scene comes right on the heels of the sparks from Namu's back.
        I think that the blood was the overriding factor for me in these
        scenes. Though I kept those sparks in mind, everything about this
        situation seems very human for a series that previously has not shown
        many robots in this kind of light. I am so glad this episode exists.
        I'm glad, even though hurts a bit for me to write about, and I feel
        like I can't even adequately describe why I'm so glad.
      </p>

      <p>
        In <i>Bubblegum Crisis</i>, the really interesting thing is that
        <b>they never let you see what these 33-S characters look like
          under their skin.</b> I think this was deliberate. The sparks in this
        scene are enough to suggest they might be robots, but the blood makes
        you unsure. I think the overall point is to make people worry about it,
        but in the end there's just so much human vulnerability that they show
        compared to all of the other varieties of Boomers we've seen so far.
        They are fragile. Whereas with alot of boomers just taking the head off
        isn't enough to stop them, these ones can bleed out. They appear to
        feel pain, sorrow, guilt, and a range of other emotions.
      </p>
      <h4 id="rambler_cruelty">Cruelty</h4>
      <p>
        To me, it feels cruel to give them such sentimentality and fragility,
        especially since in the case of these 33-S's, they were originally
        meant as sex robots. For this reason, they had to feel warm to the
        touch, and have something like flesh, and a pulse. So, given that you
        percieve them as human or sufficiently close, it seems clear that they
        are basically "born" into sex slavery.
      </p>
      <p>
        Beyond that, it means we're just offloading our own burdens onto
        something else so that they can do something for us. We give them
        both the ability to feel pain and emotions, we give them the ability
        to desire things and make their own decisions, and then we force them
        to serve us. How is that any different from slavery?
      </p>
      <p>
        I mean, <b><i>maybe</i></b> that would help solve the human trafficking
        problem (I <b>highly</b> doubt it; people can be terrible and would
        find some reason to continue being terrible), but if we make them
        behave like us to the point of giving them free will, then what has
        really changed? Nothing– except that now we can feel better about
        their subjugation, since they are not "people," but rather a consumable
        product.
      </p>
      <p>
        So, to me, at least, that's a sickening concept. Especially because, if
        AI can get that far, I could actually see this happening in the future
        (even if not by 2032, necessarily). The power of money is such that I
        am certain someone would come forward to fill that market.
      </p>
      <h4 id="rambler_chobits">Chobits</h4>
      <p>
        On the subject of emotions, it might be time to bring up <i>Chobits</i>
        now, since that was a prior influence on my thoughts on this subject.
      </p>
      <p>
        Unfortunately, Chobits has a bit of a reputation. There seem to be a
        surprising number of "neckbeards" who want robotic girlfriends because
        of their misogynistic views or bad experiences with living human
        women. This is a shame, because the manga itself is quite thoughtful
        and asks a lot of tough questions about how we would treat such robots
        (and was also authored by women). It was one of those early things I
        read that shaped my impressions of what a good manga could be, along
        with "Astro Boy" (Tetsuwan Atom).
      </p>
      <p>
        Not to get too deep into it, the major take-away I had from Chobits
        was a question: even if the 'feelings' of robots were programmed by a
        person, if they feel real to others, and they react appropriately in
        the right situations, does that distinction really matter?
      </p>
      <h4 id="rambler_imitation">The Imitation Game</h4>
      <i>(not the movie)</i>
      <p>
        The
        "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_test#Imitation_game">imitation game</a>"
        approach to the Turing test, whereby a computer and a human are
        both asked questions and tasked with responding, and an observer tries
        to tell which is which, is a test that at least in theory I can ascribe
        to as a measure of "human intelligence." The episode makes it clear
        that sylvie managed to pass this, to the extent that even with the full
        knowledge that she is a robot, Priss treated Sylvie's death as the loss
        of a friend.
      </p>
      <p>
        When Sylvie asks Priss to kill her, Priss's shock and confusion is
        palpable. Her job is destroying robots, but she clearly feels
        differently about this one (even though she also was attacking people).
      </p>
      <span class="imgwrap">
        <a href="bubblegum_1/ep5/kill_me.png">
          <img src="bubblegum_1/ep5/kill_me.png"

        </a>
      </span>
      <imgcentercaption>
        "Kill me."<br/>
        Priss sees this request not as being asked to destroy a machine, but as
        being asked to kill a friend.
      </imgcentercaption>
      <p>
        In a moment of shoc, confusion, and pressure like Priss is facing here,
        she ends up doing what was asked of her to save the city. But I have no
        idea what kind of turmoil this could bring out in her in the last three
        episodes (I hope they don't just ignore that this ever happened going
        forward).
      </p>
      <p>
        In the end, it seems quite clear to me that Priss doesn't care about
        Sylvie's "humanity," or lack thereof. Priss had already formed an
        attachment to her, as one would with any other close friend. For that
        reason, I think she passed the turing test with flying colors.

      <h4 id="rambler_reversal">Androids in Human Suits… and Humans in Android Suits</h4>
      <p>
        In order to stand a chance against hostile robots and technologies,
        in <i>Bubblegum Crisis</i> people have to use the same technologies
        which gives the robots their strength to level the playing field–
        effectively taking the characteristics of those technologies onto
        themselves. The K12 operated by Leon in this episode is a larger,
        boxier, less "human looking" form, but the more sophisticated combat
        (戦闘/<i>sentō</i>) suits donned by the Knight Sabers essentially give them a
        robotic exoskeleton while letting them move normally. So from this
        perspective, the main difference between them and boomers is that
        boomers are metal on the inside and skin on the outside, while they
        are skin on the inside and metal outside. It's a strange reversal,
        where biological humans appear less conventionally human than robots
        do.
      </p>
      <p>
        As these technologies become increasingly prevalent (and we become
        ever more dependent on them), in other words, we become cyborgs.
        Even if they contain no biological components (though Sylvie does—
        blood at the very least, and one would assume something like flesh as
        well), we become closer to them than we might admit to ourselves.
        Even now, the rise of "Internet of Things" and corporate surveillance
        devices like Echo (as well as things like augmented reality and
        even smartphones) signal (warn?) of the ever more prevalent requirement
        for people to embrace technology to be considered useful members of
        society.
      </p>
      <p>
        That doesn't mean that we necessarily have to become luddites in order
        to be "human," but it does mean that we might need to consider
        re-evaluating our definitions of humanity (especially if robots as
        sophisticated as those in <i>Bubblegum Crisis</i> existed).
      </p>
      <p>
        In a combat suit, Priss looks less like a human than the robot she
        is grieving for. Isn't that strange? I wonder if that was an
        intentional decision, or merely coincidental. I hope it was on
        purpose, but even if not it's something that I think would be
        fascinating to think more about.
      </p>
      <h4 id="rambler_sentience">Self-awareness</h4>
      <p>
        Computers cannot know their own methods of operation. For instance,
        a program cannot know how its CPU is laid out physically, or how its
        own instruction set is implemented. Likewise, humans don't really
        understand our own brains. In fact, we dissociate our sense of "self"
        from that of our brains, because in reality the brain itself is what is
        thinking "my brain." It is extremely difficult to turn compiled code
        back into human-readable code. So, in other words, a robot does not know
        inherently the reasons why its thoughts or 'emotions' work the ways
        that they do. It only knows that it has them, and that some are favored
        over others. isn't that also a lot like us? All we can do is theorize
        why people would act selflessly, or why people are protective of their
        children, because we don't really know from empirical information.
      </p>
      <h4 id="rambler_happiness">The Right to Happiness</h4>
      <p>
        No matter how much we tend to anthropomorphize robots, objects,
        and other, non-'human' animals, we (well, most of us) don't really see
        them as equals. We don't afford them with all of the same rights that
        we have.
      </p>
      <p>
        When you think about it, it seems probable that a fully grown dog or
        dolphin would be smarter and more "sapient" than a newborn baby, right?
        They have experienced some part of the world, and certainly have more
        of an idea of what it is than a newborn. But because babies tend to
        become more sapient over time, and also tend to become "adults"
        eventually (and because they are our offspring), they are given higher
        priority. This is understandable, since it's as much an instinctual
        thing as it is a social thing to care for your own child.
      </p>
      <p>
        But, what if what you deem to be your child wasn't actually considered
        to be a person at all?
      <p>
        You probably want your child to be happy, but
        if your child's happiness is programmed to have similar requirements as
        a human's, that happiness can be hard to come by, and mercurial when it
        is found. And a lot of happiness comes from the validation of others
        (for me, at least). People who are shunned or seen as abnormal often
        suffer from depression.
      </p>
      <p>
        Sylvie was brought into the world, and given something approximately
        equivaloent to sentience, only to be used as a disposable object
        (sold for sex) and denied the opportunity to find happiness. It'd
        be like having parents that didn't love you.
      </p>
      <p>
        This is where the title of this post comes from - and also a lyric in
        the song that plays during the opening credits
        ("<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M28Bhe1mzjQ">Mysterious
          Night</a>.") I think, of all the human cruelties responsible for
        Sylvie's very creation, that is what hurts most.
      </p>
      <p>
        I am not about to get too much deeper into the argument about what
        'sentience' is, only state that if to all external observers something
        appears to have sentience, it might as well have it. At some level,
        we're just analogue chemical computers, anyway. Whether <i>we</i> were
        designed or not is irrelevant here.
      </p>
      <p>
        I also don't want to get too much into the "playing God" aspect of
        this, primarily because I'm an atheist and would therefore would feel
        sort of awkward trying to push my opinions about something I don't
        really hold much stock in. But I hope that almost everyone, both
        those who think doing stuff like trying to create machines that can
        act like people are "playing God" and those who see it as an exciting
        prospect, <i>should</i> be able to agree that loving our children
        is important. Someone out there in the world of Bubblegum Crisis
        had to design these machines in full knowledge of their intended use.
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>Chobits</i> had a similar thing going on, but where the inventor of
        all the robots wanted them to be able to be happy, too. <b>(spoiler
          alert)</b> He devised a test to try to determine if humans could
        accept robots and help them find happiness, too. He likewise made a
        mechanism to "pull the plug" if the test was a failure, rather than
        let them all suffer.
      </p>
      <p>
        It's also worth pointing out that truly, no matter how much they look
        like us, robots can't be 100% identical to us. Things like Sylvie's
        "hypnosis" (I don't know what else to call it - when her eyes flashed
        red) or her ability to survive that motorcycle jump/ship crash are
        clear indicators that she can do things humans can't. But does that
        mean that she wouldn't deserve the same amount of respect or care as
        regular people, if she was living peacefully as one? I don't think
        it's fair to make them in our image to the extent that they behave
        like us socially and desire happiness, and then denigrate them as
        sub-human or not deserving happiness.
      </p>
      <h4 id="rambler_alienation">The "Sunset Scene": Alienation and Belonging</h4>
      <p>
        Besides the opening and ending, I think the most impactful moment in
        this episode was what I will dub "The Sunset scene." It is also by far
        the hardest part for me to describe what I think about it with words.
        But I will make an attempt to communicate whatever I can.
      </p>
      <p>
        Sylvie knows she's not like everyone around her. She seems lonely, even
        when she's with others on Earth. She sees something beautiful, shares
        a happy moment with someone, and then something inevitably reminds her

        Despite her desire to belong, Sylvie can never interact with the world
        in all of the ways conventional humans can.
      </imgcentercaption>
      <p>
        I guess this invisible rift between Sylvie and everyone around her
        is what I find the most wrenching about this scene. And even though I
        saw what was coming a mile away when the cat showed up, it still
        managed to have an impact for me.
      </p>
      <p>
        In a densely packed episode, this is the only time where we see Sylvie
        be able to really relax for a moment, but even this is shattered
        repeatedly. First by the Genom building reminding her of what she has
        to do – and Priss offhandedly talking to her about the "boomer trouble"
        that they have been causing – and then by the cat.
      </p>
      <p>
        This is Sylvie's sense of "alienation." The cat can tell (probably by
        scent?) that Sylvie is something different from what it has
        experienced before, and it won't trust her as a result. Sylvie has this
        deeply sad look on her face as this happens. She's just trying to be
        nice to the cat, but her artificial circumstances of "birth" stop her
        from being able to enjoy the experience. It must feel like the whole
        world is hostile to her very existance, like she can't be a part of it.
        Cursed with a "half-life." I at least would be riddled with self-doubt
        over something like that.
      </p>
      <p>
        Come to think of it, this reminds me of Frankenstein's monster's
        story with the blind man, where he was treated kindly, but only because
        the blind man couldn't see that he wasn't a regular human.
      </p>
      <p>
        I wonder if, had this episode ended differently, Sylvie could have
        found true happiness and made peace with her existance. She and Anri
        (and her companions) all display the will to live. I think that what
        Sylvie really needed was to be able to tell someone who she was,
        without having to be afraid of what they would think, or worrying that
        they'd treat her differently because of it. She presumably didn't know
        at this point that Priss was one of the Knight Sabers, but even if she
        weren't one I think Priss would have helped her to steal the disk
        anyway. It seems in-character for her - she has shown herself to be
        outgoing and strongly protective of her friends. Although, if Sylvie
        had known about the Knight Sabers already, she would probably have
        every reason to be afraid of them as a robot causing trouble in the
        city.
      </p>
      <p>
        Obviously this is all purely hypothetical, since it didn't happen. But
        I want to believe that there are people who could accept someone like
        Sylvie for who she is. She was designed so a way that she needs social
        connections like people do, so she must be profoundly lonely.
      </p>
      <p>
        I'll end this by letting a picture speak for itself.

        Lucca pities robots that were made to attack people. For every war
        machine people build, there could have been an attempt at making
        humanity better with technology. Instead, we use it to express our
        own cruelty and hatred.
      </p>
      <p>
        The opening scenes show both sides of this coin, contrasting the
        staggeringly human 33-S's with the monstrous, muder-machine
        "Dobermans." Humanity's ability to make something good, and to make
        something that actively and intentionally destroys that goodness.

      <h4 id="rambler_phantasystarii">Comparisons with <i>Phantasy Star II</i> (1989)</h4>
      <p>
        <i>Phantasy Star II</i> was released the same year as this episode, as
        an early title for the Sega Mega Drive. While I don't think it's a fun
        game to play in stock form, the story skeleton is fantastic and it
        succeeds in cultivating a moody, somewhat depressing atmosphere of
        tension mixed with resignation. The game deserves far more attention
        than it gets. It also has a surprising amount in common with
        "Moonlight Rambler," in my opinion.
      </p>
      <alert>WARNING:<br/>
        This section contains MAJOR SPOILERS for <i>Phantasy Star II</i>, an
        RPG for the Sega Mega Drive/Genesis.</alert>
      <p>
        I kind of had a bad feeling about what was going to happen to Sylvie,
        starting pretty early on in the episode. She was a new character,
        and in previous episodes I had noticed that that isn't a good sign in
        this show. I think most of them have died, so far - with the exception
        of the <strike class="strike">old man</strike> – Sorry, <i>Hasage</i>,
        J.B. Gibson, and his girlfriend, from the previous episode.
      </p>
      <p>
        I hoped I was wrong, of course. But, I mean, I played <i>Phantasy Star
          II</i>. That game has a very similar moody and dark feel to it,
        like this episode (that was released in the same year).
      </p>
      <p>
        Now, in my opinion, the game itself isn't very fun, but I love the story
        and character designs. So if you actually want to torture yourself
        playing it like I did, you should probably skip to the "end-of-spoiler"
        header below.

      <h4 id="rambler_sylvie_nei">"The Human Who Was Not a Human:" Sylvie &amp; Nei</h4>
      <p>
        Sylvie has an analogous tragic character in Phantasy Star II, named Nei.
        Nei is a half-human, half-monster that was created in a laboratory and
        escaped. She was the size of a small child when she met the protagonist,
        Rolf ('Eusis'/'Yushis' in the Japanese version), but due to her
        genetically engineered nature she grew to adult size in a period of about
        six months after meeting him.
      </p>

      <imgcentercaption>
        My favorite illustration of Nei, by original character designer Toru
        Yoshida.<br/>
        Nei has a fairly similar alienation to Sylvie, but unlike Sylvie she
        cannot hide her physically 'inhuman' nature. So her loneliness is
        differently expressed.<br/>
        Source:
        <a href="https://twitter.com/yoshibon_club/status/1167093660829278208">

      </imgcentercaption>
      <p>
        Nei's case is different in three primary ways that I can figure: firstly,
        she cannot hide that she is not a conventional human, due to her ears.
        Scondly, she is genetically engineered, and contains human genes mixed
        with those of monsters.
      </p>
      <p>
        Because of this, most people are afraid of her and shun her. There's
        a very short text-based adventure game Sega made in the early 90's that
        follows this early, pre-main-game story. It's a very sad little
        adventure, but it gives a good feel for what Nei's early life must
        have been like. Fortunately – and this is the third point that differs–
        she meets a wonderful person who lets her live with him and who raises
        her like a younger sister. This is of course Rolf/Eusis. I'll probably
        just say Rolf if or when I mention him again for simplicity.
      </p>
      <p>
        Usually I don't care for things like prequels, but this one actually
        does a very clean job of tying things into the main game's story. It's
        also much easier than the main game, so if you have an hour or two (at
        most) to kill, that text based adventure might be worth a play.
      </p>
      <p>
        The main thing the text game succeeds in doing is showing what strikes
        me as relatively true-to-life depictions of how real people treat those
        who are different from themselves.
      </p>
      <p>
        Anyway, the one good thing is that, for six months or so (half her
        life, up to that point) Nei had a home and someone who cared about
        her. She was probably happy for the most part during that time. But
        then, as things start to go wrong across the planet, things start to
        go wrong for Nei, too. In fact, she gets killed by what appears to be
        her twin.
      </p>
      <p>
        Her twin, "neifirst," never got that human compassion. Her only
        experiences with humanity have been pain and grief. Because of this,
        she has come to hate humans. She has been sabotaging the climate
        control system on the planet that keeps it from reverting into the
        desert world it was during the first game. Rolf and Nei and company
        discover Neifirst, and Nei begs her to stop. But Neifirst's hatred is
        too strong, and the only way to stop her is to attack her, which Nei
        realizes she must do.
      </p>
      <p>
        She is mortally wounded by Neifirst. In a rage, Rolf and the others
        step forward and beat Neifirst down, but it's too late to save Nei.

        I played this game a year or three before watching Bubblegum Crisis,
        and it took me a while to make that connection, but once I did it was
        hard to forget. I feel that both characters are filling the same sort
        of role of an "alien" who wants to be accepted and loved, and who is
        more human than most people recognize.

        The rationale for why they'd have blood also worked well. It was
        such a brilliant idea and execution that I'm still freaking out
        about it a little.
      </imgcentercaption>
      <span class="codewrap">
        <pre class="block">----Article under construction: drafting area----
          * Bleeding: blurs the line between humans and robots further.
          An excellent literary device.
          
          * First time in the series I can remember that robots have been
          proper protagonists. I was starting to wonder. Though I guess
          Cynthia was sort of a victim.
          
          * It's incredibly cruel to make something, give it essentially life
          (the ability to make its own decisions, to learn, everything short
          of reproduction) and then essentially enslave it - in this case,
          sexually. Is it any better than enslaving a biological human?

          * Don't they deserve happiness, if we give them the ability to express
          emotions - regardless of if we consider them "real" or not?

          * Computers cannot know their own methods of operation. For instance,
          a program cannot know how its CPU is laid out physically, or how its
          own instruction set is implemented. Likewise, humans don't really
          understand our own brains. In fact, we dissociate our sense of "self"
          from that of our brains, because in reality the brain itself is what is
          thinking "my brain." It is extremely difficult to turn compiled code
          back into human-readable code. If a robot doesn't have access to its
          own "source code," and doesn't have a way to introspect itself like
          that, doesn't that just make it even more like us?
          
          * Obviously, robots don't have to follow the "three laws," so some
          at least are very close to being people. I would consider them
          people. Sylvie died a human.
          
          * They made the conscious decision to never show the mechanics under
          Sylvie's skin.
          
          * The cat. How lonely must it feel to know you aren't "really" a
          person, but having to either completely ignore that side of yourself
          or else risk losing people you care about?
          Sylvie's sad stare when the cat is hissing at her says so much for me
          without her actually having to say anything at all.

          -- Also, it sort of gives a feeling of isolation. Isn't it kind of like
          Frankenstein's monster's visit with the blind man? Being treated
          kindly, but only as long as no one knows you aren't a human?

          -- Even if Priss would have accepted her true nature, Sylvie has no way
          of knowing that. 

          Had Sylvie been less afraid of losing her friend, and had revealed
          at least somewhat who she was, there's a chance she could have
          gained an ally for her break-in, and maybe even help for Anri in the
          meantime. I don't think Priss is the type to turn on a good
          friend without hearing them out... Although on the other hand, that
          could also be like saying "hey, I'm a boomer, and also I killed at
          least four people." Even if Priss weren't one of the Knight Sabers,
          that would be a red flag for most people.

          If she's as good of a friend as the episode makes her out to be,
          though, I think Priss would hear her out. I'm remembering the
          earlier episode (3, I think - the one where that apartment gets
          demolished and Mason dies). Priss hates Genom and also seems to
          have a strong sense of right and wrong. She likes to make money,
          but she has been shown to do almost anything to help the people
          she cares about when it gets down to it.

          Gosh, this is complicated. Sylvie isn't an innocent character,
          either. That's sort of what I like about her.

          -- I just realized while writing that: Sylvie is more like Priss
          than I first realized, despite their implied friendship being
          spelled out for me. Both of them have strong senses of justice,
          a desire for freedom, and extreme loyalty to people they care about.

          -- If people had been quicker on the uptake, and Sylia had talked to
          Priss about Sylvie, a lot of this could probably have been avoided.
          But to make a strong point, of course, this story almost had to end
          the way it did, if it wanted to have impact. Despite wanting Sylvie
          to live, it would have felt like a cop-out if she'd made it through
          the episode unscathed.

          * Namu displays an act of pure altruism by pushing sylvie and anri out
          of the way when debris falls.
          
          * The red eye thing. Apparently boomers like Sylvie can do things
          that human's can't, too. I think that is the only time they
          show Sylvie act distinctly inhuman in the entire episode. It's good
          that they put it in there, because it is sort of the Astro Boy
          thing. I think she wants to belong.

          * It's strange that they portrayed her so sympathetically when she
          is literally murdering people for their blood. She killed tons of
          people so that one person (yes, I'm calling Anri a person, based on
          the assumption she has a little depth like Sylvie did) could live.
          She acted like she was maybe a bit guilty about it at the club, but
          not enough to stop doing it.

          * Even if their emotions aren't "real" any more than human chemical
          ones, and even if they **are** simpler than human ones, why does that
          make what they think any less important?

          * Why do we have to make robots in humanoid shapes, for that matter?

          * In the end, Anri wanted Sylvie to stop, so she cared about humans.
          One can assume Sylvie also did, in the end, since she asked to be
          killed to stop the bomb from going off.

          * I guess it's sort of like the actual vampires in things like Anne
          Rice books, who often hate who they are and what they have to do to
          survive. Or even out of an obligation to help someone else.

          * Not the first time I've seen someone get murdered and leave a
          bloody mess, though. Mason in episode 3(?) is killed in an act of
          apparent vigilante justice by Sylia.

          * Was Leon conscious for this? did he discover (for real this time)
          who the Knight Sabers were?

          * I should mention Karakuri Odette and Chobits here, somewhere.

          * (derailing) This is why proprietary software is bad. If someone else
          holds the keys that let you survive, that level of power over you is
          overwhelming.

          * What's up with Daley? I think I know, but I'm not certain. Not
          that it especially matters for the episode, but Daley is certainly
          a character. Does he have a relationship with Leon, or is he just
          hitting on Leon? Does that mean Leon is bisexual?
          - Why does this matter so much to me?
          - Oh, right, because 1980's Japanese culture (and even some of the
          present culture) is often homophobic.

          (derailing a little) The art style is gorgeous.
