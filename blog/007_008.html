      <p><i>01 thru 10 Feb 2022 (ongoing)</i> [<a class="permalink" href="./007_008.html#bubblegum-review-1">Permanent link</a>]<br/>
        It's my first post of 2022, and it's also my first post that isn't about
        about technology!
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>This article is under construction, so there are disconnected
        paragraphs and other errata present. Please don't expect much until
        this is finished. In fact, if you want to get anything meaningful from
        it, you should probably ignore it until I finish writing it.</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        …Well, okay. That's a lie. It <i>kind of</i> is about technology. It's
        just more about science fiction, theoretical situations, and
        philosophy. I did <a href="/">say</a> I might not do non-tech stuff on
        my site, but here we are. Something finally motivated me to do a thought
        dump.
      </p>
      <p>
        This post (unless it derails as I write it) is primarily about an anime
        from 1987– specifically, one episode from 1989– and the thoughts that
        it provoked, both as I watched it and afterwards as I reflected.
      </p>
      <h4>Disclaimer</h4>
      <p>
        Note that I <b>very rarely</b> actually watch anime. I think this might
        be the first one I've watched since around 2015 or 2016. I read manga
        slightly more frequently, but a lot of it makes me feel uncomfortable
        with how it treats people. Particularly discomforting for me is some
        of the ways it treats women, when it comes to shonen stuff.
        <i>Shonen</i> here refers to manga that primarily targets male
        teens. To a lesser extent, it can target young adults as well.
      </p>
      <p>
        I'd like to make a brief shoutout to <i>Gintama</i> for being pretty
        respectful, while also still managing to be hilarious and irreverent.
        Haven't watched the anime, but this is at least true of the manga.
      </p>
      <p>
        ...Anyway, yes, I am aware of the irony in talking about treatment of
        women when I'm watching a show basically about "soldier girls" with
        armor that has boob plate (which shouldn't actually be necessary,
        functionally, and might endanger the sternum, should it crumple). I'm
        going to ignore this in favor of talking about the thing that actually
        interests me about this episode.
      </p>
      <h3>Foreword/Spoiler Warning</h3>
      <p>
        If you enjoy manga or anime, especially from the 80's or 90's, or if
        you liked <i>Blade Runner</i>/<i>Do Androids Dream of Electric
        Sheep</i> (or <i>Chobits</i>) a lot, I would suggest and recommend that
        you stop reading this post for now, and go watch the show up to this
        episode (or at least watch the episode itself), and then return before
        I spoil it for you. I was glad to experience this with nothing spoiled
        for me. It made it easier for me to have reflections on it that are
        genuinely my own.
      </p>
      <p>
        …Well, okay. That might also be a partial lie. Even though I was not
        spoiled on this episode, I <i>have</i> already been deeply influenced
        by things like <i>Astro Boy</i> (the manga), <i>Karakuri Odette</i>
        (the shojo manga), and the aforementioned <i>Chobits</i>. Those are
        three manga I've read specifically because they touch on the subject
        matter this episode focuses on, and each in its own way. Maybe I'll
        make this into a series of posts.
      </p>
      <p>
        I will also be spoiling details of other literary works and video
        games, so proceed with caution.
      </p>
      <p>
        Also, do note: I have not finished the series. Episode 5 was so good
        that I had to take a breather, and I also re-watched it a couple times.
        The episode feels like it has a lot to pack into its time window, but
        the ideas are strong. If more stuff happens on this topic (I think
        there's a decent chance of it – but there's only three more episodes
        to go…), I will be over the moon.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you don't want to watch all of it, at least watch episode 1 (which
        is longer than any of the others) to get an idea of the characters and
        setting. Actually, you don't even have to do that; I think you'll get
        an idea for the general setting and names of things if you watch the
        opening performance (about five minutes).
      </p>
      <p>
        With the exception of the very beginning of the opening, before the
        song kicks in (which I liked a lot; it was very atmospheric and gave a
        sense for the scale of things), this video on YouTube has the entire
        thing. This video is also the thing that made me decide I wanted to try
        watching this anime. It's pretty rare for me to make that decision, but
        I am just enamored with the art style of this show (and much of the
        other manga and anime of the time period). The fact that it is all
        hand drawn and colored just adds to the appeal; this series has
        gorgeous colors and a fantastic setting.

        Sorry for the lower than normal resolution. I don't want to get any
        trouble (not that I think anyone would really DMCA me for one or two
        higher resolution shots - but you never can tell). At least this way,
        I can claim "fair use." I also submit to the copyright holder that
        this series doesn't get very much attention, being over 30 years old,
        so you should see this as free marketing.
      </p>

      <p>
        So, Hello, and welcome; Welcome, to those of you who have no
        inclination to watch the show at any point. Welcome, those who have
        seen it already. And finally, I extend a warm welcome to theoretical
        person out there who wants to hear what some random guy in Indiana
        thinks thinks about an episode of a TV show that came out seven years
        before he was born. Thanks for listening to my shouts into the void.

      <h3>Reflections &amp; Analysis</h3>

        I might need to put a table of contents here, but we'll see how long
        this drags out.

        Sylvie.<br/>(my personal guess on the kana spelling is 「シルヴィ」.
      </imgcentercaption>
      <p>
        I am going to try to avoid just turning this into a plot summary. If
        you want to know about the plot, I suggest you watch the episode. It
        does a nice job explaining things for the viewer, in my opinion. I've
        shared this episode with a handful of friends, and they all seem to
        agree that everything comes together pretty cleanly.
      </p>
      <p>
        The crux of this topic that I kept harping on about, but never properly
        defined above, is of what can we call 'human?'
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Is something's 'humanity' totally biologically based?</li>
        <ul>
          <li>People anthropomorphize lots of non-human things and project
            their thoughts onto them.</li>
          <li>Likewise, some biological humans do monstrously evil things
            to each other.</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Do you even have to be a human in order to have the rights of one
          in human society?</li>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Moreover, can humans be expected to adapt to such a reality? It
            seems like it would be so easy to just fear them.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <li>Should such robots be given a separate status? Does one have to be
          alive to be a human? How do we define "life?"</li>
        <li>Aren't sterile people "alive" despite not being able to reproduce?
          I would say they are, but the commonly accepted definition I was
          taught in school seems to say otherwise.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        In short, then, we are addressing the quintessential "what does
        it mean to be human?" question.
      </p>
      <p>
        My theory is that people consider other things to be "people" based
        on our ingrained social behaviors and our desires to interact with
        others. Most of us don't function well in complete isolation. If I
        could be a total shut-in, and have all the time to do my tinkering with
        electronics or whatever, but I could never invite someone over or go to
        see anyone else, I'd rapidly become depressed. It has happened to a
        lot of us during this unending COVID-19 pandemic, myself included. But
        no matter how much I do need <i>some</i> degree of social interaction,
        it can often be supplemented by the sorts of attachments we get to
        inanimate objects and non-human animals.
      </p>
      <p>
        People can get attached to all kinds of things that aren't humans.
        People often feel that they are friends with their pets (especially
        dogs), and others have hobbies and passions like a musical instrument,
        or painting, or even working on a project car. I was devastated when
        my silver '91 Volvo got wrecked. Not only because I was out a car, but
        because I was out <i>that</i> car. I'd spent a lot of time and effort
        making it as good as I could - trying to ward off the rust, hand-drying
        it after a wash, and generally <i>taking better care of it than I took
          of myself</i>. I think this is related to the idea of "imprinting."
      </p>

<h4>Overcoming the Uncanny Valley</h4>
      <p>
        This behavior of imprinting, and of applying our own emotions or
        thought processes to explain the behaviors of other animals, is part
        of why I think people can be so sentimental (which I think is a good
        thing). But there's a strange thing that I and many others have
        noticed, where the closer something is to looking like us, the more
        we get unnerved by it. This is termed the "uncanny valley." That is,
        the closer to human something gets, the more we fear it as
        <i>in</i>human– at least to a point. After that point, they are
        imperceptibly different, and they become effectively seen as people.
      </p>

      <p>
        Boomers (ブーマ, "buma") in Bubblegum Crisis seem to exist on both
        sides of this uncanny valley. Many of them appear normal, but then
        their skin comes off (all the time), or metal blades slide out of their
        fingernails (episode 2, I believe), or they turn into some form of huge
        twisted metal monstrosity (episode 1), and things become incredibly
        unsettling. But those experiences in past episodes are why I find
        Sylvie, and this whole episode, so interesting. 
      </p>

      
      <p>
        They took the anthropomorphization of robots to a level I'd never even
        thought of before, by giving them blood. Sure, I've seen
        <i>Terminator</i>, and I remember that gruesome scene. But there, it
        was played for the unease. Similarly, Shigesato Itoi once said that the
        logo for the game <i>Mother 3</i> was a fusion of metal and wood
        because it is an unnatural pairing, befitting the chimera that the game
        features. It was also intended to make people uneasy. I can see what he
        means; it's a weird dichotomy.
      </p>
      <p>
        Not so much here. Here, the fusion of (wo)man and machine is done so
        deeply that you might not even be sure what you're seeing at first. At
        the very least, I was uncertain for a long time. By hiding the
        robotic parts of these boomers, <i>Bubblegum Crisis</i> forces the viewer
        to anthropomorphize them by default. The discomfort is avoided, because
        we can't see the metal that would make us uneasy. Instead, all we see
        is blood and the other things that we would typically associate with
        biological humans.
      </p>
      <p>
        Nam/Namu(?), the other gray haired girl near the beginning of the
        episode, and also seen below, displays an act of pure altruism when
        she pushes Sylvie and Anri into the ship as debris falls from above,
        sacrificing herself in the process.
      </p>
      <a href="bubblegum_1/ep5/namu_push.png">
        <img src="bubblegum_1/ep5/namu_push.png" alt="Namu pushing Sylvie and Anri into the shuttle, at the cost of her life."/>
      </a>
      <imgcentercaption>
        Namu pushes Sylvie and Anri out of danger, at the cost of her own life.
        <br/>This is the first selfless sacrifice by a robot that I've seen in
        this series.
      </imgcentercaption>
      <p>
        I've heard different theories (mostly from Radiolab/TED talks) about
        why people act altruistically. One I've heard multiple times is that
        "<i>it helps to ensure that the species as a whole survives</i>."
        I think that's a load of garbage. We are social creatures, and while
        it may be fair to say that a lot of things we do as groups are
        evolutionarily inclined, if there was a "self-sacrifice gene" one
        would expect that it would be naturally removed from the gene pool
        relatively quickly. Not everything we do has to have cold, rational
        explanations.
      </p>
      <p>
        I think this kind of sacrifice is an independent thought. I'm sure
        there are some that have done it because they don't value their lives
        as highly as someone else's, or, in Spock's words, because "the good
        of the many outweighs the needs of a few" (or one). But for me, I don't
        think I have the right kind of mind to coldly analyze costs and
        benefits when a truck is barrelling towards my friend.
      </p>
      <p>
        Putting myself in these shoes, I think the only thing I'd think is
        "I don't want to see my friend(s) get hurt." I don't even think I'd
        get as far as "how can I live with myself otherwise" before it would
        be too late to do anything but watch.

      </a>
      <imgcentercaption>The strange dichotomy of blood and electricity is on
        display here, if only for a moment.
        <br/>We also see their remarkable fragility - at least when compared to
        the boomers from episode 1 that can move without a head.
      </imgcentercaption>
      <p>
        The moment above is the moment when my brain started running at
        full-tilt. I wasn't sure if what I was seeing was simply something
        "electrified came down from above", or if it was a sign of something
        else. Having just seen what I consider to be the ultimate act of love,
        Seeing the blood, the sinking feeling in my stomach, and then the
        unexpected sparks "sparked" something in me.
      </p>
      <p>
        Unlike the discomfort I felt in the case of Mother 3, here I felt
        something more complicated. It reminded me a bit of the feeling I
        sometimes can get when I hear a truly beautiful piece of music.
        I experienced something that was beautiful in its sadness— something
        cathartic, even. I think some would call it "divine," but I didn't
        feel like I was connected to a higher power or anything. I just felt
        a knot of emotion.
      </p>
      <p>
        This feeling of awe (and anticipation) continued to grow throughout the
        entire episode from this point. I knew it was going to end in tears; I
        just wanted to know how it would get to that point. But sadness grew
        alongside my awe throughout the episode. Even as I write this,
        about a month after first watching it, I still feel something.
      </p>
      <p>
        In short, it was an extremely bittersweet feeling, the kind that I get
        when I witness something beautiful. It felt like it filled some void
        I didn't know I had... in the end, it's the kind of thing I wish I
        could cry more about, because the crying felt so good. I hope I'm
        making sense.
      </p>
      <p>
        I wouldn't necessarily call it "sadness," because I love this imagery.
        It's sort of a sublimely beautiful idea for me, for reasons I don't
        feel totally equipped to explain.
      </p>
      <p>
        The moment depicted in the image above is also the moment when this
        episode started signalling to me that it was going to have a very
        different tone than the previous ones. I noticed the spark coming from
        her back; I sort of just assumed it was because something that fell was
        electrified, butat this point, my mind also started entertaining an
        alternative explanation: that the electricity came from inside Namu.
      </p>

      <p>
        Up to this point in the show, Boomers had only really been portrayed as
        monsters wearing human skin (with the possible exception of Cynthia,
        who we really didn't get much personality from before her demise in the
        first episode). The other boomers in episode 1 didn't seem to mind much
        when their companions were destroyed; they seemed to not have anything
        like an emotional attachment to each other.
      </p>

      <p>
        But this episode suggested an alternative future for robots. Instead
        of being war machines, they could be a sort of extension of humanity.
        The "33S" type robots are physically fragile things by comparison, but
        with willpower as strong as any person's.
      </p>

      <p>
        These robots are clearly not made to be fighters. They were made to
        seem as human-like as possible, which was done so well that they even
        die like humans. When Lou (blonde) gets injured by the Doberman
        (basically a killer robot sent to prevent their escape), Meg runs to
        her. In the face of certain death, instead of running, Meg pulls lou
        closer.

      <imgcentercaption>

        their end together.<br/>
        To me, this is a profound expression of love.
      </imgcentercaption>

      <p>
        This scene comes right on the heels of the sparks from Namu's back.
        I think that the blood was the overriding factor for me in these
        scenes. Though I kept those sparks in mind, everything about this
        situation seems very human for a series that previously has not shown
        many robots in this kind of light. I am so glad this episode exists.
        I'm glad, even though hurts a bit for me to write about, and I feel
        like I can't even adequately describe why I'm so glad.
      </p>

      <p>
        In <i>Bubblegum Crisis</i>, the really interesting thing is that
        <b>they never let you see what these 33-S characters look like</b>
        under their skin. I think this was deliberate. The sparks in this
        scene are enough to suggest they might be robots, but the blood makes
        you unsure. I think the overall point is to make people worry about it,
        but in the end there's just so much human vulnerability that they show
        compared to all of the other varieties of Boomers we've seen so far.
        They are fragile. Whereas with alot of boomers just taking the head off
        isn't enough to stop them, these ones can bleed out. They appear to
        feel pain, sorrow, guilt, and a range of other emotions.
      </p>

      <p>
        Actually, that reminds me of one more thing. In the opening of episode
        2, it felt very clear to me that Genom was essentially desecrating the
        grave of a young girl and stealing from her corpse. I can't imagine
        that it wasn't on purpose. Sylia even said "to us, she was just
        a little girl who needed protecting." I think she even said that next
        time they should make the robot look like a dog.
      </p>

        This also hurt to see. Cynthia's body, in a watery grave.

      <h4>Cruelty</h4>
      <p>
        To me, it feels cruel to give them such sentimentality and fragility,
        especially since in the case of these 33-S's, they were originally
        meant as sex robots. For this reason, they had to feel warm to the
        touch, and have something like flesh, and a pulse. So, given that you
        percieve them as human or sufficiently close, it seems clear that they
        are basically "born" into sex slavery.
      </p>
      <p>
        Beyond that, it means we're just offloading our own burdens onto
        something else so that they can do something for us. We give them
        both the ability to feel pain and emotions, we give them the ability
        to desire things and make their own decisions, and then we force them
        to serve us. How is that any different from slavery?
      </p>
      <p>
        I mean, <b><i>maybe</i></b> that would help solve the human trafficking
        problem (I <b>highly</b> doubt it; people can be terrible and would
        find some reason to continue being terrible), but if we make them
        behave like us to the point of giving them free will, then what has
        really changed? Nothing– except that now we can feel better about
        their subjugation, since they are not "people," but rather a consumable
        product.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        So, to me, at least, that's a sickening concept. Especially because, if
        AI can get that far, I could actually see this happening in the future
        (even if not by 2032, necessarily). The power of money is such that I
        am certain someone would come forward to fill that market.
      </p>

      <h4>Chobits</h4>
      <p>
        On the subject of emotions, it might be time to bring up <i>Chobits</i>
        now, since that was a prior influence on my thoughts on this subject.
      </p>
      <p>
        Unfortunately, Chobits has a bit of a reputation. There seem to be a surprising number of "neckbeards" who want
        robotic girlfriends because of their misogynistic views of living human
        women. This is a shame, because the manga itself is quite thoughtful
        and asks a lot of tough questions about how we would treat such robots.
        It was one of those early things I read that shaped my impressions of
        what a good manga could be, along with "Astro Boy" (Tetsuwan Atom).
      </p>
      <p>
        The major take-away I had from Chobits was that in the end, even if
        their 'feelings' were programmed by a person, if they feel real to
        others, and they react appropriately in the right situations, does
        the distinction really matter?
        
      </p>
      
      <p>
        Computers cannot know their own methods of operation. For instance,
        a program cannot know how its CPU is laid out physically, or how its
        own instruction set is implemented. Likewise, humans don't really
        understand our own brains. In fact, we dissociate our sense of "self"
        from that of our brains, because in reality the brain itself is what is
        thinking "my brain." It is extremely difficult to turn compiled code
        back into human-readable code. If a robot doesn't have access to its own
        "source code," and doesn't have a way to introspect itself like that,
        doesn't that just make it even more like us?
      </p>      
      <p>
        In other words, a robot does not know inherently the reasons why its
        thoughts or 'emotions' work the ways that they do. It only knows that it
        has them, and that some are favored over others. isn't that also a lot
        like us?
      </p>
      <p>
        But, no matter how much we tend to anthropomorphize objects and other,
        non-'human' animals, we (well, most of us) are not really seeing them
        as equals, with all of the same rights that we have. When you think
        about it, it seems probable that a fully grown dog or dolphin would be
        smarter and more "sapient" than a newborn baby, right? They have
        experienced some part of the world, and certainly have more of an idea
        of what it is than a newborn. But because babies tend to become
        more sapient over time, and also tend to become "adults" eventually,
        they are given higher priority. This is understandable, since it's
        as much an instinctual thing as it is a social thing to care for your
        own child.
      </p>
      <p>
        But, what if what you deem to be your child wasn't actually considered
        to be a person at all? You probably want your child to be happy, but
        if your child's happiness is programmed to have similar requirements as
        a human's, that happiness can be hard to come by, and mercurial when it
        is found.
      </p>
      <p>
        That's where the title of this post comes from - and also a lyric in
        the song that plays during the opening credits ("<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M28Bhe1mzjQ">Mysterious Night</a>.")
        I think, of all the human cruelties responsible for Sylvie's very
        creation, that is what hurts most.
      </p>

      <p>
        The fact that she was brought into the world, and given something
        approximately equal to sentience, only to be used as a disposable
        object and denied an opportunity to find happiness. It'd be like having
        parents that didn't love you.
      </p>
      <p>
        I am not about to get into the argument about what 'sentience' is,
        only state that if to all external observers something appears to have
        sentience, it might as well have it. At some level, we're just
        analogue chemical computers, anyway. Whether <i>we</i> were designed
        or not is irrelevant here.
      </p>
      <p>
        I also don't want to get too much into the "playing God" aspect of
        this, primarily because I'm an atheist and would therefore would feel
        sort of awkward trying to push my opinions about something I don't
        really hold much stock in. But I hope that almost everyone, both
        those who think doing stuff like trying to create machines that can
        act like people are "playing God" and those who see it as an exciting
        prospect, <i>should</i> be able to agree that loving our children
        is important.
      </p>



      <p>
        This brings me to some comparisons to other media that might be of
        interest to you, especially if you also enjoyed this episode. I feel
        like I'll probably be pulling in a few other bits of media that I
        consider relevant.
      </p>


            <h4>Machines Don't Know Evil; Humans Make Them That Way</h4>
      <p>
        A line I've long remembered from <i>Chrono Trigger</i> (I think it was
        from the Ted Woolsey SNES translation, specifically) came from Lucca.
      </p>

      <a href="bubblegum_1/ct_robo.png">
        <img src="bubblegum_1/ct_robo.png"
             alt="Lucca repairing &quot;Robo&quot;."/>
      </a>
      <imgcentercaption>
        "<i>Machines aren't capable of evil... Humans make them that way.</i>"
      </imgcentercaption>
      
      <p>
        Lucca pities robots that were made to attack people. For every war
        machine people build, there could have been an attempt at making
        humanity better with technology. Instead, we use it to express our
        own cruelty and hatred.
      </p>

      <p>
        The opening scenes show both sides of this coin, contrasting the
        staggeringly human 33-S's with the monstrous, muder-machine
        "Dobermans." Humanity's ability to make something good, and to make
        something that actively destroys that goodness.
      </p>
      
      <h4>Comparisons with <i>Phantasy Star II</i> (1989)</h4>
      <alert><br/>WARNING:<br/>
      The following section contains major spoilers for <i>Phantasy Star II</i>
      for the Sega Mega Drive/Genesis.</alert>
    <p>
        I kind of had a bad feeling about what was going to happen to Sylvie,
        starting pretty early on in the episode. She was a new character,
        and in previous episodes I had noticed that that isn't a good sign in
        this show. I think most of them have died, so far - with the exception
        of the <strike class="strike">old man</strike> – Sorry, <i>Hasage</i>,
        J.B. Gibson, and his girlfriend, from the previous episode.
    </p>
    <p>
      I hoped I was wrong, of course. But, I mean, I played <i>Phantasy Star
        II</i>. That game has a very similar moody and dark feel to it,
      like this episode (that was released in the same year).
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, in my opinion, the game itself isn't very fun, but I love the story
      and character designs. So if you actually want to torture yourself
      playing it like I did, you should probably skip to the "end-of-spoiler"
      header below.
    </p>
    <h4>Sylvie &amp; Nei</h4>
    <p>
      Sylvie has an analogous tragic character in Phantasy Star II, named Nei.
      Nei is a half-human, half-monster that was created in a laboratory and
      escaped. She was the size of a small child when she met the protagonist,
      Rolf ('Eusis'/'Yushis' in the Japanese version), but due to her
      genetically engineered nature she grew to adult size in a period of about
      six months after meeting him.
    </p>
    <p>
      
    </p>

    <imgcentercaption>
      My favorite illustration of Nei, by original character designer Toru Yoshida.<br/>
      Nei has a fairly similar alienation to Sylvie, but unlike Sylvie she cannot hide her
      physically 'inhuman' nature.<br/>

    </imgcentercaption>
  
    <p>
      Nei's case is different in three primary ways that I can figure: firstly,
      she cannot hide that she is not a conventional human, due to her ears.
      Scondly, she is genetically engineered, and contains human genes mixed
      with those of monsters.
    </p>

    <p>
      Because of this, most people are afraid of her and shun her. There's
      a very short text-based adventure game Sega made in the early 90's that
      follows this early, pre-main-game story. It's a very sad little
      adventure, but it gives a good feel for what Nei's early life must
      have been like. Fortunately – and this is the third point that differs–
      she meets a wonderful person who lets her live with him and who raises
      her like a younger sister. This is of course Rolf/Eusis. I'll probably
      just say Rolf if or when I mention him again for simplicity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Usually I don't care for things like prequels, but this one actually
      does a very clean job of tying things into the main game's story. It's
      also much easier than the main game, so if you have an hour or two (at
      most) to kill, that text based adventure might be worth a play.
    </p>
    <p>
      The main thing the text game succeeds in doing is showing what strikes me
      as relatively true-to-life depictions of how real people treat those who
      are different from themselves.
    </p>
    <p>
      Anyway, the one good thing is that, for six months or so (half her life,
      up to that point) Nei had a home and someone who cared about her. She
      was probably happy for the most part during that time. But then, as
      things start to go wrong across the planet, things start to go wrong for
      Nei, too. In fact, she gets killed by what appears to be her twin.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her twin, "neifirst," never got that human compassion. Her only
      experiences with humanity have been pain and grief. Because of this, she
      has come to hate humans. She has been sabotaging the climate control
      system on the planet that keeps it from reverting into the desert world
      it was during the first game. Rolf and Nei and company discover Neifirst,
      and Nei begs her to stop. But Neifirst's hatred is too strong, and the
      only way to stop her is to attack her, which Nei realizes she must do.
    </p>
    <p>
      She is mortally wounded by Neifirst. In a rage, Rolf and the others step
      forward and beat Neifirst down, but it's too late to save Nei.
    </p>

    <imgcentercaption>
      Sega beat FF7 to the punch by nine years (Phantasy Star II was released
      in Japan in 1989).<br/>
      It's too bad this game will never get a (good) remake or update.
    </imgcentercaption>
    <p>
      I played this game a year or three before watching Bubblegum Crisis, and
      it took me a while to make that connection, but once I did it was hard
      to forget. I feel that both characters are filling the same sort of role
      of an "alien" who wants to be accepted and loved, and who is more human
      than most people realize on the surface level.

      Anri, bleeding. This episode does a great job of blurring the line
      where machines end and people begin.<br/>
      The rationale for why they'd have blood also worked well. It was
      such a brilliant idea and execution that I'm still freaking out
      about it a little.
    </imgcentercaption>
    
        <pre>
        ----Article under construction----
        * Bleeding: blurs the line between humans and robots further.
        An excellent literary device.
        
        * First time in the series I can remember that robots have been
        proper protagonists. I was starting to wonder. Though I guess
        Cynthia was sort of a victim.
        
        * It's incredibly cruel to make something, give it essentially life
        (the ability to make its own decisions, to learn, everything short
        of reproduction) and then essentially enslave it - in this case,
        sexually. Is it any better than enslaving a biological human?

        * Don't they deserve happiness, if we give them the ability to express
        emotions - regardless of if we consider them "real" or not?

        * Computers cannot know their own methods of operation. For instance,
        a program cannot know how its CPU is laid out physically, or how its
        own instruction set is implemented. Likewise, humans don't really
        understand our own brains. In fact, we dissociate our sense of "self"
        from that of our brains, because in reality the brain itself is what is
        thinking "my brain." It is extremely difficult to turn compiled code
        back into human-readable code. If a robot doesn't have access to its own
        "source code," and doesn't have a way to introspect itself like that,
        doesn't that just make it even more like us?
        
        * Obviously, robots don't have to follow the "three laws," so some
        at least are very close to being people. I would consider them
        people. Sylvie died a human.
        
        * They made the conscious decision to never show the mechanics under
        Sylvie's skin.
        
        * The cat. How lonely must it feel to know you aren't "really" a
        person, but having to either completely ignore that side of yourself
        or else risk losing people you care about?
        Sylvie's sad stare when the cat is hissing at her says so much for me
        without her actually having to say anything at all.

        -- Also, it sort of gives a feeling of isolation. Isn't it kind of like
           Frankenstein's monster's visit with the blind man? Being treated
           kindly, but only as long as no one knows you aren't a human?

        -- Even if Priss would have accepted her true nature, Sylvie has no way
           of knowing that. 

           Had Sylvie been less afraid of losing her friend, and had revealed
           at least somewhat who she was, there's a chance she could have
           gained an ally for her break-in, and maybe even help for Anri in the
           meantime. I don't think Priss is the type to turn on a good
           friend without hearing them out... Although on the other hand, that
           could also be like saying "hey, I'm a boomer, and also I killed at
           least four people." Even if Priss weren't one of the Knight Sabers,
           that would be a red flag for most people.

           If she's as good of a friend as the episode makes her out to be,
           though, I think Priss would hear her out. I'm remembering the
           earlier episode (3, I think - the one where that apartment gets
           demolished and Mason dies). Priss hates Genom and also seems to
           have a strong sense of right and wrong. She likes to make money,
           but she has been shown to do almost anything to help the people
           she cares about when it gets down to it.

           Gosh, this is complicated. Sylvie isn't an innocent character,
           either. That's sort of what I like about her.

        -- I just realized while writing that: Sylvie is more like Priss
           than I first realized, despite their implied friendship being
           spelled out for me. Both of them have strong senses of justice,
           a desire for freedom, and extreme loyalty to people they care about.

        -- If people had been quicker on the uptake, and Sylia had talked to
           Priss about Sylvie, a lot of this could probably have been avoided.
           But to make a strong point, of course, this story almost had to end
           the way it did, if it wanted to have impact. Despite wanting Sylvie
           to live, it would have felt like a cop-out if she'd made it through
           the episode unscathed.

        * Namu displays an act of pure altruism by pushing sylvie and anri out
          of the way when debris falls.
        
        * The red eye thing. Apparently boomers like Sylvie can do things
        that human's can't, too. I think that is the only time they
        show Sylvie act distinctly inhuman in the entire episode. It's good
        that they put it in there, because it is sort of the Astro Boy
        thing. I think she wants to belong.

        * It's strange that they portrayed her so sympathetically when she
        is literally murdering people for their blood. She killed tons of
        people so that one person (yes, I'm calling Anri a person, based on
        the assumption she has a little depth like Sylvie did) could live.
        She acted like she was maybe a bit guilty about it at the club, but
        not enough to stop doing it.

        * Even if their emotions aren't "real" any more than human chemical
        ones, and even if they **are** simpler than human ones, why does that
        make what they think any less important?

        * Why do we have to make robots in humanoid shapes, for that matter?

        * In the end, Anri wanted Sylvie to stop, so she cared about humans.
        One can assume Sylvie also did, in the end, since she asked to be
        killed to stop the bomb from going off.

        * I guess it's sort of like the actual vampires in things like Anne
        Rice books, who often hate who they are and what they have to do to
        survive. Or even out of an obligation to help someone else.

        * Not the first time I've seen someone get murdered and leave a
        bloody mess, though. Mason in episode 3(?) is killed in an act of
        apparent vigilante justice by Sylia.

        * Was Leon conscious for this? did he discover (for real this time)
        who the Knight Sabers were?

        * I should mention Karakuri Odette and Chobits here, somewhere.

        * (derailing) This is why proprietary software is bad. If someone else
        holds the keys that let you survive, that level of power over you is
        overwhelming.

        * What's up with Daley? I think I know, but I'm not certain. Not
        that it especially matters for the episode, but Daley is certainly
        a character. Does he have a relationship with Leon, or is he just
        hitting on Leon? Does that mean Leon is bisexual?
        - Why does this matter so much to me?
        - Oh, right, because 1980's Japanese culture (and even some of the
