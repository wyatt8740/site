      <h3>Coercing RGB from Retro Video Game Consoles on the Cheap<br/>
        Or:<br/>
        Modifying Game Consoles for Fun and Less Financial Damage
      </h3>
      <p><i>15 May 2020</i><br/>
        One of my long-standing hobbies (and at times mild obsessions) is
        getting everything I can out of old video game hardware. Back when I
        started getting interested in old video games, lots of these systems
        like the NES, Super NES, and so on were relatively affordable and
        cheap.
      </p>
      <p>
        Unfortunately, however, in the last ten years or so I've been noticing
        prices rise. a NES game I got for $10 to $15 might be $25 or $30 now;
        the best example I know of in my collection is Chrono Trigger, which
        seems to like selling for $100 nowadays. The best example I
        <i>don't</i> own that I would like to is Earthbound for SNES. I've
        basically given up on finding that one; it's just proof (in my mind)
        that people are sometimes crazy with the value they attribute to
        things.        
      </p>
      <p>
        In the same way, accessories for consoles are staying pretty costly,
        for the most part. And a "cottage industry" has developed around
        providing new accessories for these old systems. For me, the most
        interesting (and aggravating) of these is the manufacture of RGB video
        cables.
      </p>
      <h4>Crazy Cables</h4>
      <p>
        There are few consoles that use a "standardized" connector for any
        form of video signal of higher quality than RF. Notably, the original
        western NES revisions can output composite video and monaural audio
        using RCA jacks, which it seems manufacturers since stepped back from.
        My only guess is that they discovered they could make more profit by
        selling special cables with proprietary connectors separately from the
        consoles themselves. Maybe this has gotten better with the advent of
        HDMI, but as my newest game console is (still) a Nintendo Wii, I have
        not bothered to check this. It seems to be the case, if vague memories
        of discussions with others are anything to go by.
      </p>
      <p>
        Anyway, back to the RGB video cable issue. In the 90's, essentially
        nobody in North America had RGB-capable sets, and even those with
        15.6KHz (TV-frequency) RGB monitors for computers (like the Amiga)
        most likely didn't have cables for RGB from their consoles or even
        know that the consoles exposed RGB video signals on their A/V
        connectors. For most people, S-Video was good enough on the consoles
        that would support it. For consoles like the Sega Genesis, which didn't
        offer S-Video, though… Well, they just had to make do, I guess.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now, after a decade of (initially affordable) RGB CRT monitors from
        professional installations being readily available, the situation has
        changed. Additionally, scalers and other devices for connecting
        consoles to modern sets have appeared. The best quality video signal
        that can be had from most consoles is RGB, so there is now some demand
        for RGB video cables in North America. The cottage industry that's
        sprung up seems to be a little on the crazy side, though. All the
        prices below are the cheapest-priced options that could possibly work on
        my monitor; they are not the "optimal" or "most compatible" options
        that this particular business sells (it claims to be the number one
        option for such cables– a claim which seems very substantiated by
        the number of people I've talked to who have used them, at least.

      </p>
      <p>
        …Uh, that's <b>$152.45</b>. <i>Before shipping from the UK.</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        I never paid that much for <b>any</b> of my old consoles. In fact, that might be around as much as I paid for all of the <b>combined</b>.
      </p>
      <p>
        In 2005, I could have purchased a brand new Nintendo DS with that money.
      </p>
      <p>
        I could buy a more-than-decent brand new graphics card <i>today</i> for that much.
      </p>
      <p>
        Or maybe even purchase a textbook for a university course.
      </p>
      <p>
        And who even knows how long it'd take the package to get overseas and
        past customs! Also, if the cable ever breaks, I have to do it all
        over again. It's pretty frustrating to stop in the middle of an RPG
        (I mostly like JRPG's; I bought a Master System almost entirely for
        Phantasy Star and Ys).
      </p>
      <p>
        This is worsened by the fact that all sellers seem to be fixated on the
        idea that I'm going to use SCART for connecting my systems, which is
        silly as SCART switches are expensive, practically nothing in america
        even <i>uses</i> SCART connectors (so they're hard to source), and
        even in Europe they're rather obsolete in 2020. So to use their cables,
        I additionally have to purchase a "SCART to BNC" cable to connect to
        the back of my monitor.
      </p>
      <p>
        I guess most people into this stuff are probably older than me, have
        good paying jobs, and are further ahead in life than me as an
        undergraduate studying at a university. Still, those prices are a
        pretty huge barrier to entry for a near-minimum-wage worker in a state
        where the minimum wage is still $7.25.
        Even after I was lucky enough to get a nice RGB CRT or two by mostly
        luck and chance (with maybe a pinch of initiative-taking. Possibly a
        teensy bit of soliciting as well).
      </p>
      <h4>A More Economical Way</h4>
      <p> I have seven consoles that I play somewhat often.  Of those, five
        output RGB as their highest-quality option, one outputs component video
        (the Wii), and one outputs composite video (my Famicom, which is modded
        and can output composite like an american NES can).
        I have four in the images above, since I already have something that I
        got at the same time as my Amiga 500 which obviates my problems there
        (a 23-pin-Amiga-RGB to VGA adapter; used with my Commodore 1942
        monitor).
      </p>
      <p>
        The Famicom and the Wii are the easiest to get top quality out of; I
        modded the Famicom for composite video myself and was able to re-use
        the existing holes in the back of the shell for composite video via
        RCA and dual mono audio via a TRS jack. The Wii was super easy, because
        I was able to get a new (third-party but decent quality) component
        (YPbPr) multi-system cable meant for it, the XBox 360, and the PS3 on
        clearance at a GameStop in around 2014 or 2015.
      </p>
      <p>
        Most of my other consoles I drilled holes in to add RCA jacks to carry
        Red, Green, and Blue signals, as well as a composite sync signal. In a
        couple cases, I added S-Video jacks as well. However, on the original
        PlayStation, this is harder to do since there's a thick metal RF
        shielding plate which doubles as a support structure for the CD pickup
        mechanism. This means I can't just remove it. It comes up really close
        to the plastic on the back of the console. Additionally, for all the
        times that I've done it, I don't actually like cutting holes in my
        systems if I can easily avoid it. With the PSX, I have managed to
        avoid doing so while staying economical.
      </p>
      <p>
        Okay, now that all that build-up and context has been brought into the
        light, I can get to the point of this post. These things always end up
        way longer than I expect them to. Sorry. I start writing and just don't
        stop sometimes (At least that carries over into documenting my code as
        well).
      </p>
      <p>
        The actual clever idea I had was involving the original Playstation;
        it's essentially a way to avoid having to shell out the big bucks for
        imported cables or cut holes in your precious systems. Depending on
        your revision of PSX, there are two easy routes you can take if you
        don't want to actually modify your system but want to get RGB out of
        it.
      </p>
      <h4>PSX Revision Identification</h4>
      <p>
        There are actually a bunch of micro-revisions of the original
        Playstation, but for this particular post's purposes we can
        use a radically simplified shorthand version of it. We can do this
        since only one of those differences really matters here, and it's a
        rather blatantly obvious difference when examining a Playstation unit.
        Probably the first one most average people would notice.
        You tell me if you can spot it.
      </p>
      <a href="./rgb_stuff/full/psx_diff_01.jpg"><img src="./rgb_stuff/psx_diff_01.jpg" alt="Picture of two different-revision PlayStation units."/></a>
      <p>
        If your answer was, “The top one has seen better days,” well, you'd
        be right. If I can ever work up the courage to show pictures of the
        repair work I've done inside, you'll see that you're more right than
        you could possibly have known. As it is, though, I'm slightly ashamed
        of how it looks inside, even though I did what had to be done
        for it to work properly again. It definitely required an inordinate
        amount of time and effort to get it to 100% when compared to all of my
        other consoles.
      </p>
      <p>
        In any case, that's not actually the important distinction, just
        another “story for another time.” Unless you are using a browser that
        doesn't show pictures (like Lynx), you can probably also see the lack
        of RCA jacks on the bottom one. That's the actual important difference
        here for the purposes of this post.
      </p>
      <p>
        The sharpie'd word "LUMA" written on the console with the jacks is
        tangentially relevant, but since this post is already so long I'll
        save it for another time. It's only marginally important as an
        improvement to the basic idea I'm trying to communicate in an overly
        verbose manner, but I basically just re-routed the S-Video luma line
        to the yellow RCA jack for a slightly more stable sync signal than
        the composite signal with color information would be able to provide.
      </p>
      <p>
        You see, very early original PlayStation units came with RCA jacks
        (and in Japan, even a standard S-Video connector at first). Later
        units removed those. Unfortunately, this removal roughly coincided with
        Sony's transition from a truly terrible CD drive design to a simply
        mediocre one.
      </p>
      <p>
        The mediocre one was <i>definitely</i> much better than the original,
        since it had the upshot of not grinding itself out of alignment over
        the span of a few years. This unfortunate tendency seems to have made
        original units with jacks rather less common, though I suppose that
        could also just be because they were most expensive at launch and had
        less games available at first. So maybe they just didn't sell too many
        by comparison to the wave that was to come.
      </p>
      <p>
        Or maybe I've just had strange luck with what units show up in stores,
        so my idea of the statistics are skewed.
      </p>
      <p>
        Anyway, the unfortunate thing is that if your system has RGB jacks, and
        it's not been serviced at some point, it probably has one of the really
        unreliable drives inside and probably already struggles reading discs.
        Unlike the later units, where simply oiling the spindle motor is
        usually all they need to work perfectly, the early units basically just
        need to be replaced if you want them to be dependable. I did so with
        mine, but it requires having a drive to swap in (and usually pulling
        from another newer, working console).        
      </p>
      <p>
        So either your system has the RCA jacks built in and is unreliable,
        or you have to buy one more thing to derive RGB from newer ones (still
        more affordably than those cables above). I'll explain this other
        solution for newer systems now.
      </p>
      <h4>On Systems With RCA Jacks</h4>
      <p>
        Anyway, if you have the revision with the RCA jacks, and your CD drive
        is miraculously working (be it due to repairs, incredible luck, or
        some other form of high wizardry), then all you need to get RGB out
        of your playstation is a PS3 component video cable and an additional
        single RCA cable.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you want to get rid of the DC coupling on the video signals, however,
        you will need to do more work internally that I'm not covering in this
        post because I've been typing this for over two hours now. I've done
        it, but it is not strictly necessary and not doing so is nowhere near
        as bad as not removing the DC coupling from audio signals (speakers are
        sensitive to it, but TV's really aren't).
      </p>
      <p>With that caveat in mind, all you have to do for basic RGB output is
        to run a wire from the yellow RCA jack to your sync input. Most
        screens will accept this as sync. Then the component cable's Y line
        goes to Green, Pb goes to Blue, and Pr goes to Red. Use three
        RCA-to-BNC adapters on the back of your screen, if yours uses
        them.
      </p>
      <h4>On Systems Without RCA Jacks</h4>
      <p>
        You'll need to find a “guncon” (light gun) adapter; I recommend the
        Sony SCPH-1160, since it's an official product and it has a fully
        populated AV connector that passes through everything to another
        “A/V Multi Out” connector on the far end. I haven't used others,
        so I'm not sure if they will carry all signals like this does.
      </p>
      <p>
        It's also, coincidentally, the only official Sony product I've seen
        in person with a fully-populated A/V connector! Unfortunately, it
        seems strangely uncommon on ebay at the moment. I found mine in a
        local used game store for $5 or so, though, so I guess you might just
        have to stay vigilant. They don't seem to go over $10 or $15, even on
        ebay where everything with old video games seems overvalued now.
      </p>
      <p>
        …Boy, am I going to love getting older. I can already see the
        bitterness starting. I'll have to keep that in check.
      </p>
      <a href="./rgb_stuff/full/scph_1160.jpg"><img src="./rgb_stuff/scph_1160.jpg" alt="Picture of SCPH-1160 guncon adapter/RCA breakout."/></a>
      <a href="./rgb_stuff/full/scph_1160_2.jpg"><img src="./rgb_stuff/scph_1160_2.jpg" alt="Another picture of SCPH-1160, showing the connector for an additional A/V cable at the far end."/></a>
      <p>
        My particular SCPH-1160 has had the same mod done as the 1001 has internally,
        where I replaced the yellow RCA jack's composite output with the
        S-Video luma output. I additionally connected the composite signal to
        the multi-out so that it can be passed through if desired. I might
        post pictures of that later, but I've been working on this post for a
        long time, so I'm not really feeling like taking it apart again right
        now. You don't actually have to perform any mods inside it for this to
        work; there's just a very slight possible improvement to sync stability
        that can result from it.
      </p>
      <p>
        You can also (if you so desire) add decoupling capacitors for the RGB
        lines inside of an SCPH-1160, but again, it is not likely to matter
        for anything but audio signals which already have been decoupled inside
        the PSX.
      </p>
      <p>
        So basically, you just use this 1160 dongle or similar as a breakout to
        give you the same RCA jacks you'd get from an early revision system.
        From there, you've got your sync signal, and so you can deliver the
        remaining R/G/B (and audio) signals through a PS3 component cable.
        PS3 component cables use the same pins for Y/Pb/PR as earlier systems
        would use for G/B/R, respectively, so this works out rather well.

      <h3>CDemu: A Brief Tour<br/>
        Or:<br/>
        How I played Quake with the music CD on a computer without a CD Drive
      </h3>
      <p><i>03 Feb 2020</i><br/>
        (This isn't really anything too tricky, but since it took me a few
        minutes to figure out and I had to do some grepping in the source code
        I figured I should mention it.)
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quake_%28video_game%29">
          Quake</a> (1996) is a great game. I know it, and if you didn't
        already, now you do, too. Better still, the engine source code is
        freely available under a nice license, so if you have an original CD
        you can port it to whatever machine you want and use the CD's assets to
        play the game on that system. I know there are nicer forks around, but
        I chose to build an engine as close as possible to the original source
        code as dropped by Id/John Carmack (I'm too young to remember the
        initial code drop, so I don't know how exactly that's attributed).
      </p>
      <p>
        I got it to build with just a few minor tweaks (like having to force
        gcc to build it for i386 (32-bit) with `-m32`) after installing
        the 32 bit versions of the libraries it depends on) and changing a
        couple hardcoded paths in a makefile.
      </p>
      <p>
        The problem is, though, that most (all?) modern-ish optical drives
        don't have an audio output that can be mixed into a sound card like
        old-school CD drives usually did. Quake would play music tracks off the
        disc just like an audio CD player (CDDA player) would, from 'red book'
        audio stored as tracks on the game disc. My laptop's most certainly
        doesn't, and neither do the drives in my desktop, which are both
        rather new since I lack IDE on my motherboard and my PCI IDE controller
        only supports hard disks.
      </p>
      <p>
        It turns out that (for Linux kernels at least)
        <a href="https://cdemu.sourceforge.io/">CDemu</a> is capable of
        handling cue/bin or toc/bin CD images as if they were physical discs
        in a virtual physical drive. That includes red book audio playback.
        So I ripped my Quake CD with `cdrdao` (since I use debian; other
        distros may use different tools) to make a .toc/.cue pair (TOC is
        cdrdao's preferred format, but it can be converted to .cue as needed).
      </p>
      <p>
        After building and installing CDemu (it is not packaged in Debian,
        although they do provide .deb packages I could probably have used
        instead. Since I run a custom kernel I didn't want to have to deal with
        any incompatibilities, so I just did a source build), as well as
        GCDemu (a GUI for it), I was nearly there, but audio still wouldn't
        play.
      </p>
      <p>
        I figured out after inspecting the man pages and source code that
        cdemu-daemon uses `libao` to play back audio, and that it defaulted
        to pulseaudio, which I do not use and never want to have to deal with
        ever again (long story for another time, it goes back nearly as far
        as my starting to use Linux distros when I was around 13… about ten
        years ago now). Turns out they let you change the audio driver being
        used with a configuration file at `~/.cdemu-daemon`. I just made the
        file and put the following line in it, and then restarted
        `cdemu-daemon`:
      </p>
      <p>
        <pre class="block">AUDIO_DRIVER=alsa</pre>
      </p>
      <p>
        Since I already had a nicely configured ALSA setup (another story for
        another time) that allows more than one program to play sound at once,
        this was all it took. According to the man page, some other options are
        `oss`, `pulse`, and `null`. There may be more, but I don't know what
        all libao supports. The documentation also says it defaults to `null`,
        but never says where to change it; I figured out that the file is
        `~/.cdemu-daemon` while grepping through the sources to find out how
        the daemon started when `gcdemu` is run. Now however, I can play X11
        Quake with music as it was intended!

      <h3>The POSIX Shell and You<br/>
        Or:<br/>
        How You're Likely Misusing #!/bin/sh</h3>
      <p><i>14 July 2019</i><br/>
        Hello. My first blog post is a bit of a rant, but hopefully you
        feel like you learned something from it. I mainly write this for
        my peers – CS students who possibly don't know much about the
        history of Unix, or what a POSIX shell means. The kind of people
        who have only surface level knowledge of Unix/Linux, but spend
        most of their time in Windows.<br>
      </p>
      <p>So, first off. Your shell on your Ubuntu or other generic
        GNU/Linux system is almost certainly <a
          href="https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/">bash</a>. There's
        absolutely nothing wrong with this in and of itself; bash is
        great, and for interactive use, probably a good way to get used
        to bourne-like shells. Maybe 'bourne shell' doesn't ring a bell
        to some of you. I'll do my best to explain it.<br>
      </p>
      <p><font color="#990000"><b>TL;DR: Please use '#!/usr/bin/env
            bash' if you want to write a bash script; bash is not always
            the same as /bin/sh.</b></font><br>
      </p>
      <h4>A History Lesson</h4>
      <p>Caveat – I was born in 1996, after most of the dust from the
        events I am about describe had already settled or was quickly
        settling. By the time I was old enough to have any sort of
        experience with these events, they were already very old. But I
        love learning about history of basically everything, and
        especially about fields that interest me.<br>
        –OK, now that that's out of the way…<br>
      </p>
      <p>Essentially, the earlier widely used versions of Unix were in
        two camps: <i>commercial</i> Unix, such as <a
          href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UNIX_System_V">System V</a>
        ("System Five"), and <i>research</i> Unix, such as "Version 7".
        Don't worry about the numbers in the names too much – if it
        helps, know that the commercial unix releases made by AT&amp;T
        all used roman numerals, and were derived from research Unix
        with some nice toys and tools added in. Most notably, for this
        discussion, those tools included an early version of the <a
          href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KornShell">Korn Shell</a>
        (or ksh, so named because of its initial author, David G. Korn).<br>
      </p>
      <p>None of these Unix systems were free of cost - AT&amp;T
        required a licensing payment, which gave the purchaser a copy of
        the source code for the operating system to do whatever he or
        she wanted with. AT&amp;T was, if I understand correctly,
        required in the late 70's and early 80's, required to license
        its software like this because of the way it was regulated by
        the government prior to the 1984 break-up of the Bell System,
        which was up until that time a government regulated
        (near-)monopoly. The <a
          href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_Systems_Research_Group">UC



          Berkeley Computer Systems Research Group</a> was a licensee,
        and some academics (students and faculty) began modifying and
        adding to their installation, sharing their software with other
        paid Unix licensees (other academic institutions, for instance).
        By the early 90's, AT&amp;T had raised licensing costs for
        commercial unices to the extent that the CSRG decided to
        re-write all of the remaining AT&amp;T code in their version of
        the OS. This became the source of modern FreeBSD, NetBSD,
        OpenBSD, MirBSD, and others (to an extent, Mac OS X is also a
        descendant of the last CSRG BSD release).<br>
      </p>
      <h4>Legal Issues</h4>
      <p>I bring all of this up because due to its ownership, the Korn
        shell was not available to users that did not have a valid
        license from AT&amp;T. Korn shell was and is vastly powerful,
        and also is compliant with a standard known as POSIX (or
        Portable Operating System Interface). This is a standard that,
        if followed, aimed to allow scripts and programs written for one
        compliant operating system to run on any other compliant system.
        POSIX is largely modelled on System V commercial Unix, with some
        later additions and removals. Un-encumbered BSD's at first had
        to use 'csh', a non-compatible alternative shell, and later on
        largely or entirely POSIX compatible shells such as the <a
href="https://www.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=sh&amp;sektion=1&amp;manpath=freebsd-release-ports">Almquist






          Shell</a>. These are less powerful than modern ksh (ksh93) in
        many respects, but performed their functions, especially the
        almquist shell ([t]csh has lots of problems I won't get into
        here). But Ksh's absence before it became 'free software' was
        felt in the form of incompatible scripts.<br>
      </p>
      <h4>Enter the POSIX Shell</h4>
      <p>In the world of shells, POSIX was originally important because
        if a script was written for the theoretical "<a
          href="http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/">POSIX
          Shell</a>," using only software that follows the POSIX
        standard, it should be able to run the same on an IBM AIX system
        as it would on a Sun Solaris or SGI IRIX workstation.<br>
        Today, it is slightly less vitally important to follow it to the
        letter, but I argue that it still should be a concern. The
        reasons for this are varied:<br>
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>Having a particular shell does not necessarily mean that all
          of the other programs called by the shell will be the same on
          other platforms.<br>
          (Mac OS X has bash, but its version of tools like 'sed' are
          derived from the BSD's, and are often missing some options
          compared to the heavily-expanded GNU versions found in <a
            href="https://www.gnu.org/software/coreutils/">coreutils</a>).</li>
        <li>The same CLI option flag might serve a different purpose
          entirely in other operating systems or distributions.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>So, if you want your script to run on a Mac at some point, it
        makes sense to limit yourself to the features that are
        guaranteed to be on the Mac (which is currently a certified
        POSIX-compliant platform). The same goes for the other BSD's,
        except that they aren't <i>officially</i> certified as
        compliant (they are at least 99% compliant, though).<br>
      </p>
      <p>A benefit of following this approach was that I was able to
        transfer nearly all of my shell-based tools in my ~/bin
        directory (where I keep local programs I want to be able to
        execute from anywhere at any time) directly to a mac and to a
        FreeBSD installation, and have them work flawlessly. By
        initially avoiding things like 'sed -i,' I was able to save
        myself time later.<br>
      </p>
      <ol>
      </ol>
      <p>Now for the fun part, and where the title of this post came
        from:</p>
      <p> '#! /bin/sh' is often found at the top of shell scripts. Any
        POSIX compliant shell will see this as a comment, but an <i>extension</i>
        that many follow, which comes from early versions of research
        Unix, is that if a file starts with '#!', the remainder of that
        line is to be seen as the program to pass the file as an
        argument to.</p>
      <p> While a POSIX shell is not necessarily going to execute your
        file that has '#! /bin/env python' by running '/bin/sh
        /path/to/script.sh', it may do so, and otherwise will simply
        execute in the same type of shell as the one that called it.</p>
      <p> '/bin/sh' usually refers to the Bourne shell – for all intents
        and purposes, the shell that the POSIX shell (and Korn
        Shell/Bash) grew out of and are based upon. By specifying it,
        you are saying that your program will run correctly in <i>what
          is likely (<a
            href="https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/009695399/utilities/sh.html">but






            not guaranteed</a>) to be the default shell of the entire
          system</i>. This is almost always a POSIX shell.</p>
      <p>FreeBSD <i><a
href="https://www.freebsd.org/doc/en_US.ISO8859-1/articles/linux-users/shells.html">does






            not</a> even include Bash in a default installation</i>.
        Even if it is installed, it will be in /usr/local/bin, if
        installed via ports or the binary package manager, so your
        #!/bin/bash shebang <i>still</i> won't do the job! By using
        '#!/bin/sh', you are (in my mind) essentially saying one of
        three things:<br>
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>You are pretty sure your script will run on anything with a
          minimally compliant bourne-like shell with possibly POSIX
          extensions. If there's a problem, it's likely a minor
          oversight that can be fixed pretty easily in a text editor in
          a few minutes.<br>
        </li>
        <li>You don't care about anyone who isn't using a GNU/Linux
          system, or your particular installation of your other
          operating system.</li>
        <li>Your script is only for your own personal use, and you don't
          intend on sharing it, but it does what you want on your
          system, so that's okay.</li>
      </ol>
      <h4>Conclusions</h4>
      <p>Basically, I'd urge you to <i>look up the tools you see
          recommended in Stack Overflow answers</i>– Think to yourself,
        "Huh, I wonder if this program has this flag in its POSIX
        definition, or if this is an extension." Maybe your tool isn't
        in POSIX at all! Then, I'd like you to decide – does that
        matter, in this particular case? Are you trying to maximize the
        utility of your script for others on multiple platforms? Do you
        only have to worry about a single known target? Are you just
        trying do something fast and get it over with so you can move on
        with your life? I do all of these sometimes, but if your intent
        is to share, please consider sticking to the basics!<br>
      </p>
      <p>I hope this didn't come across as too negative, and was
        somewhat informative. Sorry it turned out so big. I'll probably
        edit it over the next couple days for size and coherence, since
        I am sure I lost my train of thought in a couple of places.
        Thanks for reading.<br>
