      <h3>The POSIX Shell and You<br>
        Or<br>
        Why You're Likely Misusing #!/bin/sh</h3>
      <p><i>14 July 2019</i><br>
        Hello. My first blog post is a bit of a rant, but hopefully you
        feel like you learned something from it. I mainly write this for
        my peers – CS students who possibly don't know much about the
        history of Unix, or what a POSIX shell means. The kind of people
        who have only surface level knowledge of Unix/Linux, but spend
        most of their time in Windows.<br>
      </p>
      <p>So, first off. Your shell on your Ubuntu or other generic
        GNU/Linux system is almost certainly <a
          href="https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/">bash</a>. There's
        absolutely nothing wrong with this in and of itself; bash is
        great, and for interactive use, probably a good way to get used
        to bourne-like shells. Maybe 'bourne shell' doesn't ring a bell
        to some of you. I'll do my best to explain it.<br>
      </p>
      <p><font color="#990000"><b>TL;DR: Use #!/usr/bin/env bash if you
            want to write a bash script; it's not the same as #!/bin/sh.</b></font><br>
      </p>
      <h4>A History Lesson</h4>
      <p>Caveat – I was born in 1996, after most of the dust from the
        events I am about describe had already settled or was quickly
        settling. By the time I was old enough to have any sort of
        experience with these events, they were already very old. But I
        love learning about history of basically everything, and
        especially about fields that interest me.<br>
        –OK, now that that's out of the way…<br>
      </p>
      <p>Essentially, the earlier widely used versions of Unix were in
        two camps: <i>commercial</i> Unix, such as <a
          href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UNIX_System_V">System V</a>
        ("System Five"), and <i>research</i> Unix, such as "Version 7".
        Don't worry about the numbers in the names too much – if it
        helps, know that the commercial unix releases made by AT&amp;T
        all used roman numerals, and were derived from research Unix
        with some nice toys and tools added in. Most notably, for this
        discussion, those tools included an early version of the <a
          href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KornShell">Korn Shell</a>
        (or ksh, so named because of its initial author, David G. Korn).<br>
      </p>
      <p>None of these Unix systems were free of cost - AT&amp;T
        required a licensing payment, which gave the purchaser a copy of
        the source code for the operating system to do whatever he or
        she wanted with. AT&amp;T was, if I understand correctly,
        required in the late 70's and early 80's, required to license
        its software like this because of the way it was regulated by
        the government prior to the 1984 break-up of the Bell System,
        which was up until that time a government regulated
        (near-)monopoly. The <a
          href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_Systems_Research_Group">UC


          Berkeley Computer Systems Research Group</a> was a licensee,
        and some academics (students and faculty) began modifying and
        adding to their installation, sharing their software with other
        paid Unix licensees (other academic institutions, for instance).
        By the early 90's, AT&amp;T had raised licensing costs for
        commercial unices to the extent that the CSRG decided to
        re-write all of the remaining AT&amp;T code in their version of
        the OS. This became the source of modern FreeBSD, NetBSD,
        OpenBSD, MirBSD, and others (to an extent, Mac OS X is also a
        descendant of the last CSRG BSD release).<br>
      </p>
      <h4>Legal Issues</h4>
      <p>I bring all of this up because due to its ownership, the Korn
        shell was not available to users that did not have a valid
        license from AT&amp;T. Korn shell was and is vastly powerful,
        and also is compliant with a standard known as POSIX (or
        Portable Operating System Interface). This is a standard that,
        if followed, aimed to allow scripts and programs written for one
        compliant operating system to run on any other compliant system.
        POSIX is largely modelled on System V commercial Unix, with some
        later additions and removals. Un-encumbered BSD's at first had
        to use 'csh', a non-compatible alternative shell, and later on
        largely or entirely POSIX compatible shells such as the <a
href="https://www.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=sh&amp;sektion=1&amp;manpath=freebsd-release-ports">Almquist





          Shell</a>. These are less powerful than modern ksh (ksh93) in
        many respects, but performed their functions, especially the
        almquist shell ([t]csh has lots of problems I won't get into
        here). But Ksh's absence before it became 'free software' was
        felt in the form of incompatible scripts.<br>
      </p>
      <h4>Enter the POSIX Shell</h4>
      <p>In the world of shells, POSIX was originally important because
        if a script was written for the theoretical "<a
          href="http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/">POSIX
          Shell</a>," using only software that follows the POSIX
        standard, it should be able to run the same on an IBM AIX system
        as it would on a Sun Solaris or SGI IRIX workstation.<br>
        Today, it is slightly less vitally important to follow it to the
        letter, but I argue that it still should be a concern. The
        reasons for this are varied:<br>
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>Having a particular shell does not necessarily mean that all
          of the other programs called by the shell will be the same on
          other platforms.<br>
          (Mac OS X has bash, but its version of tools like 'sed' are
          derived from the BSD's, and are often missing some options
          compared to the heavily-expanded GNU versions found in <a
            href="https://www.gnu.org/software/coreutils/">coreutils</a>).</li>
        <li>The same CLI option flag might serve a different purpose
          entirely in other operating systems or distributions.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>So, if you want your script to run on a Mac at some point, it
        makes sense to limit yourself to the features that are
        guaranteed to be on the Mac (which is currently a certified
        POSIX-compliant platform). The same goes for the other BSD's,
        except that they aren't <i>officially</i> certified as
        compliant (they are at least 99% compliant, though).<br>
      </p>
      <p>A benefit of following this approach was that I was able to
        transfer nearly all of my shell-based tools in my ~/bin
        directory (where I keep local programs I want to be able to
        execute from anywhere at any time) directly to a mac and to a
        FreeBSD installation, and have them work flawlessly. By
        initially avoiding things like 'sed -i,' I was able to save
        myself time later.<br>
      </p>
      <ol>
      </ol>
      <p>Now for the fun part, and where the title of this post came
        from:</p>
      <p> '#! /bin/sh' is often found at the top of shell scripts. Any
        POSIX compliant shell will see this as a comment, but an <i>extension</i>
        that many follow, which comes from early versions of research
        Unix, is that if a file starts with '#!', the remainder of that
        line is to be seen as the program to pass the file as an
        argument to.</p>
      <p> While a POSIX shell is not necessarily going to execute your
        file that has '#! /bin/env python' by running '/bin/sh
        /path/to/script.sh', it may do so, and otherwise will simply
        execute in the same type of shell as the one that called it.</p>
      <p> '/bin/sh' usually refers to the Bourne shell – for all intents
        and purposes, the shell that the POSIX shell (and Korn
        Shell/Bash) grew out of and are based upon. By specifying it,
        you are saying that your program will run correctly in <i>what
          is likely (<a
            href="https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/009695399/utilities/sh.html">but





            not guaranteed</a>) to be the default shell of the entire
          system</i>. This is almost always a POSIX shell.</p>
      <p>FreeBSD <i><a
href="https://www.freebsd.org/doc/en_US.ISO8859-1/articles/linux-users/shells.html">does





            not</a> even include Bash in a default installation</i>.
        Even if it is installed, it will be in /usr/local/bin, if
        installed via ports or the binary package manager, so your
        #!/bin/bash shebang <i>still</i> won't do the job! By using
        '#!/bin/sh', you are (in my mind) essentially saying one of
        three things:<br>
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>You are pretty sure your script will run on anything with a
          minimally compliant bourne-like shell with possibly POSIX
          extensions. If there's a problem, it's likely a minor
          oversight that can be fixed pretty easily in a text editor in
          a few minutes.<br>
        </li>
        <li>You don't care about anyone who isn't using a GNU/Linux
          system, or your particular installation of your other
          operating system.</li>
        <li>Your script is only for your own personal use, and you don't
          intend on sharing it, but it does what you want on your
          system, so that's okay.</li>
      </ol>
      <h4>Conclusions</h4>
      <p>Basically, I'd urge you to <i>look up the tools you see
          recommended in Stack Overflow answers</i>– Think to yourself,
        "Huh, I wonder if this program has this flag in its POSIX
        definition, or if this is an extension." Maybe your tool isn't
        in POSIX at all! Then, I'd like you to decide – does that
        matter, in this particular case? Are you trying to maximize the
        utility of your script for others on multiple platforms? Do you
        only have to worry about a single known target? Are you just
        trying do something fast and get it over with so you can move on
        with your life? I do all of these sometimes, but if your intent
        is to share, please consider sticking to the basics!<br>
      </p>
      <p>I hope this didn't come across as too negative, and was
        somewhat informative. Sorry it turned out so big. I'll probably
        edit it over the next couple days for size and coherence, since
        I am sure I lost my train of thought in a couple of places.
        Thanks for reading.<br>
