      <i>You are destroying the planet.</i>

      <p>I am not even exaggerating when I say that.</p>
      <p>Computing hardware has grown a lot in the last 50 years or so; a
        single chip powered by a couple of AA batteries now can do incredible
        things that would have required an AC mains connection before. I'd like
        to first applaud the efforts of all the researchers, scientists, and
        engineers who have gotten us to this point.
      </p>
      <p>
        But no matter how much we grow our capabilities, we are never happy
        with it.
      </p>
      <p>
        We only target increased performance; no one markets their products
        to consumers with the intent of keeping them mindful of power
        consumption. Indeed, that gets brushed under the rug, because
        "look at this ray-tracing!" or more recently "Look! AI!!! Buy our
        product!".
      </p>
      <p>
        If the public were informed in marketing about the importance of
        sustainability, and humanity as a whole (INCLUDING corporate America)
        really were to try to advance computing and electronics in general
        with a goal of <i>'consuming less power each generation to achieve the
        SAME performance'</i> instead of <i>'increasing "performance" &ndash;
        those penguins had it coming, anyway'</i>, then MAYBE we'd actually be
        starting to fix things, instead of accelerating our energy consumption
        for Somebody Else (our children and grandchildren) to deal with.
      </p>
      <p>
        Google recently added an "AI Overview" field to its search results,
        which means every single search that gets fed through that is now
        consuming computing time on a GPU or other special silicon somewhere.
        <b>Companies are now experimenting with putting datacenters
        <i>in the ocean</i> because they are paying so much in water bills to
        keep their servers cool</b>, even as the public is being told to ration
        water in places like California that are experiencing drought and
        wildfires. Nvidia is launching GPU's for datacenters that draw <b>in
        excess of one kilowatt</b> which <i>they anticipate they will sell
        <b>3,500,000</b> of.</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        By the way, "carbon offsets" are smoke and mirrors, with little
        evidence to support the idea that paying them actually makes a company
        carbon neutral.
      </p>
      <p>
        It's not just hardware engineers and engineering companies or IT firms
        that should be ashamed; programmers should, too. We keep demanding
        more and more, using more CPU cycles to perform the same tasks we
        were doing in the 1990's, but rewritten in some higher level language
        to keep employed.
      </p>
      <p>
        If we were still content to play games that looked like Quake, or even
        like <i>The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess</i> or <i>Portal 2</i>,
        and if we were still content to have static webpages, or
        server-rendered pages that didn't automatically update without user
        interaction via REST API's and Javascript, then I suspect that even
        though the population has grown and there are now a billion more
        people on the planet than when I was in school, our energy consumption
        might not be the unmitigated disaster it is now. We've grown complacent
        (or maybe we always were?), and have decided that we can just tell the
        user to buy a more powerful computer (and produce more e-waste).
      </p>
      <p>
        The takeaway that I'm trying to get at here is this:
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>
          Increasing performance per watt will not save the planet unless you
          don't also increase your expectations of performance proportionately.
        </i>
      </p>
      <p>
        We need to stop looking the other way and dismissing this as "someone
        else's problem" because every single time we do a google search and see
        an "AI overview," we should not think <i>huh, that's neat.</i> We should
        be <i>angry.</i> Because these companies have once again shown us that
        they do not actually care about anything but perpetual growth for
        stockholders. They do not have a responsible bone in their bodies with
        the weight and power to actually make the changes that need to be made.
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>
          You, yes,</i> <b>you</b> <i>(insert A.I. company here)</i>, are killing
          the planet, all while you pat yourself on the back for destroying
          the careers of artists and programmers alike by replacing them.
      </p>
      <p>
        And you should be ashamed.
      </p>
      <p>
        And if you care at all, you should lower your expectations of computers.
      </p>
